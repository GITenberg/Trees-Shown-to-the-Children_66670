<p class="drop-cap">DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;In this little book I have
written about some of the trees which you
are likely to find growing wild in this country,
and Miss Kelman has painted for you pictures
of these trees, with drawings of the leaves and
flowers and fruit, so that it will be easy for you
to tell the name of each tree. But I think there
is one question which you are sure to ask after
reading this small book, and that is, &#8220;How do
the trees grow?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tree grows very much as we do, by taking
food and by breathing. The food of the tree is
obtained from two sources: from the earth and
from the air. Deep down in the earth lie the
tree roots, and these roots suck up water from
the soil in which they are embedded. This water,
in which there is much nourishment, rises through
many tiny cells in the woody stem till it reaches
the leaf, twigs, and green leaves. As it rises the
growing cells keep what they need of the water.
The rest is given off as vapour by the leaves
through many tiny pores, which you will not be
able to see without a microscope.</p>

<p>While it is day the green leaves select from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
the air a gas called carbonic acid gas. This
they separate into two parts called oxygen and
carbon. The plant does not need the oxygen as
food, so the leaves return it to the air, but they
keep the carbon. This carbon becomes mixed
in some strange way with the water food drawn
from the soil by the roots. Forming a liquid, it
finds its way through many small cells and
channels to feed the growing leaves and twigs
and branches.</p>

<p>But, like ourselves, a tree if it is to live and
thrive must breathe as well as take food. By
night as well as by day the tree requires air for
breathing. Scattered over the surface of the
leaves, and indeed over the skin of the tree, are
many tiny mouths or openings called stomata.
It is by these that the tree breathes. It now
takes from the air some oxygen, which, you will
remember, is the gas that the leaves do not
need in making their share of the tree food.
Now you can see why it is that a tree cannot
thrive if it is planted in a dusty, sooty town. The
tiny mouths with which it breathes get filled up,
and the tree is half-choked for lack of air. Also
the pores of the leaves become clogged, so that
the water which is not needed cannot easily
escape from them. A heavy shower of rain is a
welcome friend to our dusty town trees.</p>

<p>As a rule tree flowers are not so noticeable as
those which grow in the woods and meadows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
Often the ring of gaily-coloured petals which
form the corolla is awanting, so are the green
or coloured sepals of the calyx, and the flower
may consist, as in the Ash tree, of a small seed-vessel
standing between two stamens, which have
plenty of pollen dust in their fat heads.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to notice the various ways
in which the tree flowers grow. In some trees
the stamens and seed-vessels will be found close
together, as in the Ash tree and Elm. Or they
may grow on the same branch of a tree; but all
the stamens will be grouped together on one
stalk and all the seed-vessels close beside it on
another stalk, as in the Oak tree. Or the stamen
flowers may all be found on one tree without
any seed flowers, and on another tree, sometimes
a considerable distance away, there will
be found nothing but seed flowers. This occurs
in the White Poplar or Abele tree.</p>

<p>You must never forget that both kinds of
flowers are required if the tree is to produce
new seed, and many books have been written to
point out the wonderful ways in which the wind
and the birds and the bees carry the stamen
dust to the seed-vessels, which are waiting to
receive it.</p>

<p>Each summer the tree adds a layer of new
wood in a circle round the tree trunk; a broad
circle when there has been sunshine and the
tree has thriven well, and a narrow circle when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
the season has been wet and sunless. This new
layer of wood is always found just under the
bark or coarse, outer skin of the tree. The bark
protects the soft young wood, and if it is eaten
by cattle, or cut off by mischievous boys, then
the layer of young wood is exposed, and the tree
will die.</p>

<p>When winter approaches and the trees get
ready for their long sleep, the cells in this layer
of new wood slowly dry, and it becomes a ring
of hard wood. If you look at a tree which has
just been cut down, you will be able to tell how
many years old the tree is by counting the circles
of wood in the tree trunk. When a tree grows
very slowly these rings are close and firm, and
the wood of the tree is hard and valuable.</p>

<p>Many, many years ago, when a rich Scotch
landlord lay dying, he said to his only son, &#8220;Jock,
when you have nothing else to do, be sticking
in a tree; it will aye be growing when you are
sleeping.&#8221; He was a clever, far-seeing old man,
Jock&#8217;s father, for he knew that in course of time
trees grow to be worth money, and that to plant
a tree was a sure and easy way of adding a
little more to the wealth he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>But a tree has another and a greater value
to us and to the world than the price which a
wood merchant will give for it as timber. Think
what a dear familiar friend the tree has been
in the life of man! How different many of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
best-loved tales would be without the trees
that played so large a part in the lives of our
favourite heroes. Where could Robin Hood and
his merry men have lived and hunted but under
the greenwood tree? Without the forest of Arden
what refuge would have sheltered the mischief-loving
Rosalind and her banished father? How
often do we think of the stately Oak and Linden
trees into which good old Baucis and Philemon
were changed by the kindly gods.</p>

<p>And do you remember what secrets the trees
told us as we lay under their shady branches on
the hot midsummer days, while the leaves danced
and flickered against the blue, blue sky? Can
you tell what was the charm that held us like
a dream in the falling dusk as we watched their
heavy masses grow dark and gloomy against
the silvery twilight sky?</p>

<p>In a corner of a Cumberland farmyard there
grew a noble tree whose roots struck deep into
the soil, and whose heavy branches shadowed
much of the ground. &#8220;Why do you not cut it
down?&#8221; asked a stranger; &#8220;it seems so much in
the way.&#8221; &#8220;Cut it down!&#8221; the farmer answered
passionately. &#8220;I would sooner fall on my knees
and worship it.&#8221; To him the tree had spoken
of a secret unguessed by Jock&#8217;s father and by
many other people who look at the trees with
eyes that cannot see. He had learned that the
mystery of tree life is one with the mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
that underlies our own; that we share this
mystery with the sea, and the sun, and the
stars, and that by this mystery of life the whole
world is &#8220;bound with gold chains&#8221; of love &#8220;about
the feet of God.&#8221;</p>

THE OAK</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF all our forest trees the Oak is undoubtedly
the king. It is our most important tree, the
monarch of our woods, full of noble dignity and
grandeur in the summer sunshine, strong to endure
the buffeting of the wintry gales. It lives
to the great age of seven hundred years or more,
and is a true father of the forest. We read of the
Oak tree in the story books of long ago. There
are many Oak trees mentioned in the Bible. In
Greece the Oak was believed to be the first tree
that God created, and there grew a grove of
sacred Oaks which were said to utter prophecies.
The wood used for the building of the good ship
Argo was cut from this grove, and in times of
danger the planks of the ship spoke in warning
voices to the sailors.</p>

<p>In Rome a crown of Oak leaves was given to him
who should save the life of a citizen, and in this
country, in the days of the Druids, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
many strange customs connected with the Oak
and its beautiful guest the mistletoe. The burning
of the Yule log of Oak is an ancient custom which
we trace to Druid times. It was lit by the priests
from the sacred altar, then the fires in all the
houses were put out, and the people relit them
with torches kindled at the sacred log. Even
now in remote parts of Yorkshire and Devonshire
the Yule log is brought in at Christmas-time
and half burned, then it is taken off the fire and
carefully laid aside till the following year.</p>

<p>We know that in Saxon times this country
was covered with dense forests, many of which
were of Oak trees. Huge herds of swine fed
on the acorns which lay in abundance under the
trees; and a man, when he wished to sell his piece
of forest, did not tell the buyer how much money
the wood in it was worth, but how many pigs
it could fatten. In times of famine the acorns
used to be ground, and bread was made of the
meal. There have been many famous Oak trees
in England: one of these we have all heard of&mdash;the
huge Oak at Boscobel in which King Charles
II. hid with a great many of his men after he
was defeated at the battle of Worcester.</p>

<p>I think you will have no difficulty in recognising
an Oak tree (1) at any time of the year. Look at
its trunk in winter: how dark and rough it is;
how wide and spreading at the bottom to give
its many roots a broad grip of the earth into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
they pierce deeply. Then as the stem rises it
becomes narrower, as if the tree had a waist, for
it broadens again as it reaches a height where the
branches divide from the main trunk. And what
huge branches these are&mdash;great rough, dark arms
with many crooked knots or elbows, which shipbuilders
prize for their trade. These Oak-tree
arms are so large and heavy that the tree would
need to be well rooted in the ground to stand firm
when the gale is tossing its branches as if they
were willow rods.</p>

<p>The Oak tree does not grow to a great height.
It is a broad, sturdy tree, and it grows very slowly,
so slowly that after it is grown up it rarely increases
more than an inch in a year, and sometimes
not even that. But just because the Oak
tree lives so leisurely, it outlasts all its companions
in the forest except, perhaps, the yew tree, and its
beautiful hard, close-grained wood is the most
prized of all our timber.</p>

<p>In the end of April or early in May, the Oak
leaves (2) appear; very soft and tender they are
too at first, and of a pale reddish green colour.
But soon they darken in the sunshine and become
a dark glossy green. Each leaf is feather-shaped
and has a stalk. The margin is deeply waved
into blunt lobes or fingers, and there is a strongly-marked
vein up the centre of the leaf, with slender
veins running from it to the edge.</p>

<p>In autumn these leaves change colour: they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
become a pale brown, and will hang for weeks
rustling in the branches till the young buds which
are to appear next year begin to form and so push
the old leaves off. If a shrivelling frost or a
blighting insect destroys all the young Oak leaves,
as sometimes happens, then the sturdy tree will
reclothe itself in a new dress of leaves, which
neither the Beech, nor the Chestnut, nor the
Maple, could do. It shows what a great deal of
life there is in the stout tree.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Oak arrive about the same
time as the leaves, and they grow in catkins
which are of two kinds. You will find a slender
hanging catkin (3) on which grow small bunches of
yellow-headed stamens (4). Among the stamens
you can see six or eight narrow sepals, but these
stamens have no scales to protect them as the
Hazel and Birch catkins have. On the same
branch grows a stouter, upright catkin, and on it
are one or maybe two or three tiny cups (5), made
of soft green leaves called bracts, and in the centre
of this cup sits the seed-vessel, crowned with
three blunt points. As the summer advances this
seed-vessel grows larger and fatter and becomes
a fruit (6) called an acorn, which is a pale yellow
colour at first, and later is a dark olive brown.
The soft leafy cup hardens till it is firm as wood,
and in it the acorn sits fast till it is ripe. It
then falls from the cup and is greedily eaten by
the squirrels and dormice, as it was in the olden
times by the pigs. From those acorns that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
left lying on the ground all winter, under the
withered leaves, will grow the tiny shoots of a
new tree when the spring sunshine comes again.</p>

<p>The Oak tree is the most hospitable of trees:
it is said that eleven hundred insects make their
home in its kindly shelter. There are five kinds
of houses, which are called galls, built by insects,
and you can easily recognise these, and must look
for them on the Oak tree. Sometimes on the
hanging stamen catkins you will find little balls
like currants with the catkin stem running
through the centre. These are the homes of a
tiny grub which is living inside the currant ball,
and which will eat its way out as soon as it is
ready to unfold its wings and fly.</p>

<p>Often at the end of an Oak twig you find a soft,
spongy ball which is called an Oak apple. It is
pinkish brown on the outside and is not very
regular in shape. This ball is divided inside into
several cells, and in each cell there lives a grub
which will also become a fly before summer is over.</p>

<p>Sometimes if you look at the back of an Oak
leaf you will see it covered with small red spangles
which are fringed and hairy. These spangles each
contain a small insect, and they cling to their
spangled homes long after the leaves have fallen
to the ground.</p>

<p>Another insect home or gall grows in the leaves,
and this one is much larger, sometimes as big as
a marble. It too is made by an insect which is
living inside, and this is called a leaf gall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>There is still another insect which attacks the
leaf buds and causes them to grow in a curious
way. Instead of opening as usual, the bud proceeds
to make layers of narrow-pointed green
leaves which it lays tightly one above the other,
like the leaves of an artichoke or the scales of
a fir cone. If you cut one of these Oak cones in
half you will find many small insects inside, which
have caused the bud to grow in this strange way.</p>

<p>And there is one other oak gall you must note.
When the leaves have all fallen and the twigs
are brown and bare, you see clusters of hard
brown balls growing on some of them. They
are smooth and glossy and the colour of dried
walnuts. These also have been made by an insect.
Sometimes you see the tiny hole in the ball by
which the grub has bored its way out. This kind
of gall does great harm to the tree, as it uses up
the sap that should nourish the young twigs.</p>

<p>The wood of the Oak is very valuable. Sometimes
a fine old tree will be sold for four hundred
pounds, and every part of it can be used.
The bark is valuable because it contains large
quantities of an acid which is used in making
ink; also in dyeing leather. Oak that has been
lying for years in a peat bog, where there is much
iron in the water, is perfectly black when dug out,
black as ink, because the acid and the iron together
have made the inky colour.</p>

<p>The wood of an Oak tree lasts very long: there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
are Oak beams in houses which are known to be
seven hundred years old, and which are as good
as the day they were cut. For centuries our
ships were built of Oak, the wooden walls of old
England, hearts of Oak, as they have often been
called, because Oak wood does not readily splinter
when struck by a cannon ball. And Oak wood
will not quickly rot: we know of piles which
have been driven into river beds centuries ago
and are still sound and strong. In pulling down
an old building lately in London, which was built
six hundred and fifty years ago, the workmen
found many oak piles in the foundations, and
these were still quite sound.</p>

THE BEECH</h2>
</div>

<p>In the south of England there lived a holy hermit
named St. Leonard whose hut was surrounded by
a glade of noble Beech trees. The saint loved the
beautiful trees, but by day he could not sit under
their shady branches because of the vipers which
swarmed about the roots, and by night the songs
of many nightingales disturbed his rest. So he
prayed that both the serpents and the birds might
be taken away, and from that day no viper has
stung and no nightingale has warbled in the
Hampshire forests. So we read in the old story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
books. There are many such legends connected
with the Beech tree. It has grown in this country
as far back as we have any history, and it is often
called the mother of the forest, because its thickly
covered branches give shelter and protection to
younger trees which are struggling to live.</p>

<p>The Beech is a cousin of the Oak. It is a large,
handsome tree, with a noble trunk and widely
spreading branches which sweep downward to the
ground, and in summer every branch and twig is
densely covered with leaves. No other tree gives
such shade as the Beech, and in a hot summer day
how tempting it is to lie underneath the branches
and watch the squirrels glancing in and out among
the rustling leaves and tearing the young bark.</p>

<p>In early spring you will recognise the Beech
tree (1) by its smooth olive-grey trunk. Only the
Beech tree has such a smooth trunk when it is
fully grown, and in consequence, every boy with
a new knife tries to cut his name on its bark.
In summer the young bud (3) of next year&#8217;s leaf
is formed where each leaf joins the stem. All
winter time you can see slender-pointed buds (4)
growing at the end of every twig, and when April
comes each of these pointed buds has become a
loose bunch of silky brown scales. Inside these
protecting scales is hidden the young leaf bud, and
soon the winter coverings unclose. For a short
time they hang like a fringe round the base of
the leaf stalk, but they quickly fall off and strew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the ground beneath. The young leaves inside are
folded like a fan, and they have soft silky hairs
along the edges. How lovely they are when
open! Each leaf (2) is oval, with a blunted point
at the end, and the edges are slightly waved.</p>

<p>At first the leaf colour is a clear pale green,
through which the light seems to shine; and
there is nothing more lovely than a Beech tree
wood in early May when the young leaves are
glistening against the clear blue sky. But as
summer comes nearer the leaf colour darkens, and
by July it is a deep, glossy green. You can then
see very distinctly the veins which run from the
centre to the edge of every leaf. These leaves
grow so thickly that no stems or branches can be
seen when the tree is in full foliage; and they are
beautiful at all seasons. When autumn comes,
bringing cold winds and a touch of frost, then the
Beech tree leaves change colour: they seem to
give us back again all the sunshine they have
been storing up during summer, for they blaze
like the sunset sky in myriad shades of gold, and
red, and orange. In windy open places, these
beautiful leaves soon strew the ground with a
thick carpet that whirls and rustles in every
breeze. But in sheltered glades, and especially in
hedges, the leaves will hang all winter till they
are pushed off by the new spring buds, and they
glow russet red in the December sunshine, like
the breast of the robin that is singing on the twig.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>At every stage the Beech tree is a thing of
beauty, and it is one of England&#8217;s most precious
possessions.</p>

<p>The young flowers appear about the same time
as the leaves, and, like many other trees, the Beech
has two kinds of flowers. The stamen flower (6)
has a long, drooping stalk, from the end of which
hangs a loose covering of fine brown scales,
with pointed ends. Beyond this scaly covering
hangs a tassel of purplish brown stamens, eight
or twelve, or more, each with a yellow head.</p>

<p>On the same twig, not very far distant, you find
the seed flower (5). This grows upright on a short
stout stalk which bears at the end a bristly oval
ball (7). At the top of this bristly ball you see six
slender threads waving in the air. These rise from
two seeds which are enclosed in the bristly covering.
By and by the ball opens at the top and
forms a cup with four prickly brown sides, each
lined with silky green down. Inside the cup are
two triangular green nuts which are the fruit (8).
These nuts become dark brown when they ripen,
and on windy days they are blown in thousands
from their coverings and fall to the ground, where
they lie hidden among the rustling brown leaves.</p>

<p>In old times people called these Beech nuts
Beech-mast or food, and herds of pigs were taken
to the Beech woods to feed on the nuts, which are
said to contain oil. But pigs prefer to eat acorns,
and nowadays the Beech nuts are left to fatten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>the squirrels and dormice, and the thrushes and
deer, except those which children gather to
string into necklaces.</p>

<p>No grass or plant will grow below the Beech
tree branches: the leaves are too close together
to let the sunshine reach the ground; also the
roots are greedy, and are said to use up all the
nourishment.</p>

<p>About a hundred years ago a Beech tree was
found in Germany whose young leaves were dark
purple red, and never became green. Young plants
from this strange tree were much sought after,
and now in many parts of the country you see red
or copper beeches, as we usually call them.</p>

<p>Beech wood is used in various ways. In France
the peasants make it into shoes&mdash;wooden shoes
called sabots, which keep out the damp better than
those made of any other wood. It is also used in
ship-building and for making cheap furniture; but
Beech wood is not nearly so valuable as that of the
Oak, or Ash, or Elm.</p>

THE BIRCH</h2>
</div>

<div class="first">&#8220;Sweet bird of the meadow, soft be thy nest,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright">&mdash;Leyden.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The Birch tree is the daintiest and most fairy-like
of all our forest trees, and, strange to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
it is one of the hardiest. Who would believe that
the delicate tracery of purple twigs and branches,
which looks like fairy fretwork against the grey
wintry sky, could thrive in places where the sturdy
Oak tree dies?</p>

<p>In the far, far north, in Lapland, where the
ground is snow-covered all the year, the Birch
tree flourishes, and many are the uses to which
it is put in that dreary land.</p>

<p>Look at the Birch tree (1) early in the year
before the sun has awakened the trees, and
flowers, and seeds from their long winter sleep.
It is easy to recognise, because no other tree
has such delicate twigs and branches, and the
colour of the trunk is peculiarly its own. Most
tree trunks are grey, or grey-green, or brown,
but the trunk of the Birch is covered with
a silvery white bark that glistens like satin.
In many places this bark is marked with dark
bands which crack across the tree trunk on the
silvery surface.</p>

<p>This silver bark is a wonderful thing. It peels
off readily in large flakes which resemble tissue
paper, and which look very easy to destroy, but
are wonderfully tough and lasting. It burns
readily, but in almost no other way can it be
destroyed. If a Birch tree is blown down and
left lying on the damp ground for many years,
all the wood inside the silvery bark will decay,
but the outside of the trunk remains unchanged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Stand on it, and you find that what you took to
be a solid tree is nothing but a hollow tube of
bark.</p>

<p>In North America the Indians cover their canoes
with Birch bark, and in some snow-covered countries
the people use it for tiles with which to
roof their houses. Some time ago, when men
were digging in the peat-bogs of Lancashire, they
found the remains of Birch trees which must
have been there for a thousand years. The wood
had turned into stone, but the bark was still the
same as when it grew on the tree.</p>

<p>In April the young leaves (2) cover the tree like
a green mist. They are very tiny, the smallest
and most fairy-like of all our tree leaves. Each
leaf is oval in shape, with a glossy surface, and
has a double row of teeth, first a large tooth,
then a smaller one, cut unequally all round the
edge. The leaf stalk is very slender and wiry,
and the twig to which it is attached is very little
stouter, so that the leaves dance and rustle in
the slightest breath of wind. Sometimes the back
of a Birch leaf is covered with fine yellow powder.
This powder is really a tiny plant which has
made its home on the Birch tree leaf and feeds
on it, just as the ivy and mistletoe do on larger
trees. In autumn these leaves turn pale yellow,
and the moss and heather are strewn with their
flakes of gold.</p>

<p>There is another stranger makes its home on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
some of the Birch trees. In spring, before the
leaves come, you may often notice curious bunches
of twigs that look like crows&#8217; nests high up
among the branches. These are caused by a
tiny insect which has come to stay on the Birch
tree, and, in some way which we do not understand,
it makes all the twigs crowd together in
that curious manner. &#8220;Witches&#8217; Knots&#8221; they
are called in Scotland.</p>

<p>In May the Birch tree is in flower. You know
that tree flowers are not so easy to see as meadow
flowers: they require to be sought for and looked
at carefully if you wish to know about them.
The Birch tree has two kinds of flowers, and
both are needed if the seed from which new trees
may grow is to be made ready. It takes the
tree a whole year to prepare one kind of flower.
During summer look at the foot of a leaf stalk,
where it joins the twig, and you will find two tiny
green stamen catkins (4) with all their soft scales
tightly closed together. In autumn these little
catkins become dark purple, and they hang on
the tree all winter. Early in the following spring
they change entirely. The scales unclose and
the catkins grow longer till they look like a pair
of caterpillars loosely shaking in the wind.
Behind the scales in these reddy-brown caterpillars
you find a mass of flowers, each made up
of one tiny sepal, also two slender stamens with
small yellow heads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Now look at the other kind of flower, the seed
catkin (3). These also are small and green, but
they grow singly and are fatter and rounder than
the stamen catkins. Their scales never open very
wide, but if you look closely you will see behind
each scale three little pear-shaped seed-vessels
with two slender horns standing up from the top
of each.</p>

<p>When the seeds in this catkin are ripe they
resemble tiny nuts with wings on each side (5):
and on windy days you can see clouds of these
little winged seeds (5<i>a</i>) fluttering to the ground
like small flies. Birds are very fond of Birch tree
seeds, and one kind of finch, the siskin, is usually
found hovering among the Birch trees.</p>

<p>The Birch tree lives till it is about a hundred
years old. It is not grown up till it is twenty-five,
so you will find no seeds on the young
birches. It is a tree with many useful qualities.
The bark is sometimes twisted into torches, as
it contains a good deal of oil, and it is also used
in tanning leather. The delicious scent of Russian
leather is due to Birch bark oil. And there is
sugar in the sap which may be made into wine.
Furniture is largely made from the prettily grained
Birch wood.</p>

THE ALDER</h2>
</div>

<p>The Alder tree (1) is a cousin of the Birch and
the Hazel, and like them its flowers and seeds
are borne in catkins. It is usually to be found
growing by the side of a slow-running stream,
over which its slender branches bend gracefully,
while its spreading roots cling to the boggy soil
at the water&#8217;s edge. For the Alder does not
thrive in dry ground: it is a water-loving tree, and
its many tiny roots attract moisture, and suck it
up greedily; so that the ground where the Alder
grows is often a marshy swamp.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will find an Alder which has
grown into a lofty tree with a rough brown-black
bark, and with many large branches; but it is
much more frequently found as a low-growing
and rather gloomy bush, about the same size as
the Hazel.</p>

<p>The wood of the Alder is much sought after for
buildings which stand in water. In Venice one of
the most famous bridges, the Rialto, is built on
piles, or great posts of Alder driven deep into the
bed of the canal: and one reads in old history
books that boats were first made of the trunks of
the Alder tree. But it is of no use for fences or
gate posts, as it decays quickly in dry soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>If you watch a woodman cutting down an Alder
tree you will notice that the chips which fall under
his axe are very white; but soon they change
colour and become a reddish pink. The hard
wood knots which are found in the tree trunk are
beautifully streaked and veined and are much
prized by furniture makers.</p>

<p>In early spring you should walk to the banks of
a stream and look for an Alder tree. Like the
Hazel, you will easily know it by its winter
catkins, though these are very different from
Hazel catkins. Clinging to the boughs you see
groups of small brown oval cones, which are
quite hard and woody and which snap off easily.
These woody cones are the withered seed catkins
(5) of last year. As well as these you find bunches
of long drooping caterpillars with tightly-shut
purple-green scales, which will not unclose till
the spring days come. These are the young
stamen catkins, and they have taken six months
to grow so far. By these you will always
know the Alder tree; and it is most interesting
to watch day by day how its catkins grow
and change.</p>

<p>In spring the tree produces many groups of
tiny seed catkins (4), which are hard and oval and
covered with closely-shut green scales. As the
days get warmer these cones grow larger and
larger, and one day you will find the scales opening
as a fir cone does when it is ripe. Underneath
each scale are hidden two seeds, and from the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of each seed rise two slender horns. There are
no wings to the seed, as in the Birch tree. These
seed cones grow fatter and larger all summer,
and by autumn their scales, instead of remaining
green and soft, have become a dark reddish brown
colour and are hard and woody. In
October or November the seed is quite ripe,
and is shaken on to the boggy ground below.
Then the empty seed catkins become dry and
shrivelled, and they remain in groups clinging to
the twigs all winter.</p>

<p>But the drooping caterpillars have been growing
and changing too. Soon after the seed catkins
have unclosed their hard oval balls, so that the sun
and light may reach their tiny seeds, these drooping
stamen catkins (3) unclose, and their scales
take on a deeper shade of reddish purple. Each
scale is edged with three points, and each point
covers four tiny stamens and four tiny petals.
When the fine powder in the yellow stamen heads
is ripe, the wind blows it from the dangling tails
on to the seed cones which are waiting for it, as
without the stamen powder the seeds would never
ripen: and soon after this happens the dangling
tails fall to the ground.</p>

<p>If you look at an Alder tree in late autumn you

dangling stamen catkins with the fine stamen
dust all blown away; and third, there are tiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
little caterpillar catkins with their scales still

<p>The leaves (2) of the Alder are heavy and leathery.
They are usually rounded at the tips, but sometimes
they are square, as if a piece had been cut off.
Each leaf is prettily toothed all round the edge,
and the veins, which run from the centre rib to the
margin, are very much raised. When the leaves
are newly opened, the under-side is covered with
tufts of soft down, and they are slightly sticky.
Sometimes they are tinged with dull purple.
These leaves are placed alternately on the stem,
and while still in bud each leaf is enclosed in a
pair of oval sheaths like small yellow ears. These
ears do not fall off when the leaf unfolds, as do the
leaf coverings of the Birch and the Beech; you
will often find them at the bottom of the leaf stalk
when the leaf is fully grown.</p>

THE HORNBEAM</h2>
</div>

<p>This is a tree that many people tell you they
have never noticed; even people who know the
names of most of our forest trees look surprised
if you ask them which is the Hornbeam (1); they
have never heard of it. And yet it grows freely
in England in the woods and hedgerows, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
like the Beech it is invaluable for sheltering with
its close bushy branches younger trees that are
struggling to live. If left to grow in good soil
the Hornbeam will become a tall tree over seventy
feet high, but it is not usual to find such well-grown
Hornbeams, because the tree is generally
planted to form hedges, and as these require
thickness and bushiness rather than height, the
top of the tree is often cut off, so that all its
strength may go to producing side-branches.</p>

<p>Last century it was the fashion to have curious
puzzle-paths made in gardens. You entered at
a gap in a leafy hedge and walked on and on,
and in and out between growing hedges till you
came to an open space in the centre. Then the
puzzle was to find your way out again, and this
was sometimes very difficult. This kind of puzzle-path
was called a maze, and the hedges of these
mazes were frequently made of Hornbeam, because
this tree will allow itself to be clipped and cut
into any shape, and if its tall spreading branches
are taken away, it at once puts out many small
side-shoots which form a thick hedge.</p>

<p>The Hornbeam branches have a curious habit of
growing together where they cross each other.
You may find two good-sized branches which
are separate on the lower part of the tree, but
higher up they cross and touch each other, and
frequently they join together and become one
branch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>In the town of Ghent in Belgium there is a
winding walk arched with Hornbeam: the trees
have been planted so close that they meet overhead,
and they have then been clipped and cut till
they form a green tunnel under which you can
walk for three hundred yards.</p>

<p>The trunk of the Hornbeam is a dull grey
colour, and it is marked with white spots. It
is not round, as are most tree trunks, but looks
as if it had been slightly flattened, and so made
oval when it was young. The leaves are not
unlike those of the Elm and the young Beech, and
when the tree is young it is sometimes mistaken
for one or other of these. But you will notice
some differences if you look carefully.</p>

<p>The Hornbeam leaf (2) is oval and tapers to
a sharp point. It has strongly-marked veins
running from the centre to the edge of the leaf,
and these veins stand up like cord on the under-side
of the leaf. You remember that the Beech
leaf was smooth and glossy, and that the Elm
leaf was rough and hairy? The Hornbeam comes
just between the two: it is too rough to be a
Beech leaf, and is also too pointed, and it is too
smooth to be an Elm leaf. Besides, the two
sides of the Hornbeam leaf meet exactly opposite
each other on the leaf stalk, and in the Elm the
one side of the leaf very often joins the stalk
farther down than the other: the leaf is lopsided.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>The Hornbeam leaves have two rows of teeth
round the edge, and in autumn they turn yellow,
and this yellow colour changes into red-brown as
the winter draws near. In sheltered places the
leaves will hang on the branches all winter, till
in spring they are pushed off by the young
leaf buds.</p>

<p>The Hornbeam has two kinds of flowers, which
grow in catkins, and both are found on the same
tree. The stamen catkins (3) come with the young
leaves early in April, and they grow on those twigs
which were produced last year. It is not possible
to mistake the Hornbeam for either the Beech
or the Elm if you see the flowers, for neither of
these has hanging catkins like the Hornbeam.
Each catkin is made up of many green scales
covering the catkin loosely. These scales are
broad and oval, and they end in a sharp point.
Hidden at the foot of each scale lies a thick
bunch of yellow-headed stamens with no petals
and no sepals around them. These yellow stamen
heads end in tufts of fine hairs, and they are
filled with pollen dust. As soon as this dust
is ripe the yellow heads burst and scatter it
over the seed flowers which have been making
ready to receive it. After this the stamen
catkins shrivel, and they soon fall from the
tree.</p>

<p>But there are other Hornbeam flowers, also
growing in catkins (4) which appear at the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
this year&#8217;s young twigs. Each catkin is covered
with soft, silky spear leaves, and behind every three
of these narrow leaves there nestles a tiny seed
with two little horns standing up at the top.
These silky leaves soon fall off and are replaced
by others which are very different. These are
called bracts, and they look like a small hand
with one long finger and two much shorter fingers.
They are covered with a network of fine veins,
and inside the hand sits the fruit (5), a small
three-sided nut. When you see a bushy, drooping
cluster of these green leafy bracts, each with
its nut at the foot, you wonder how any one
could mistake the Hornbeam for either the Beech
or the Elm.</p>

<p>You will often see a dainty little bird called
the hawfinch sitting on the Hornbeam branches
and eating the nuts.</p>

<p>The wood of this tree is said to be very hard.
Joiners do not care to work on Hornbeam, as it
quickly blunts their tools; and some people tell you
that the name is really Hard-beam, and that we
have got into a careless habit of calling the tree
by a wrong name. But there is another tale which
may be the true one. Long ago, when ploughing
was done by bullocks in this country, as it is
to-day in many lands, each pair of bullocks was
fastened together with a wooden collar called a
yoke. This yoke was made of Hornbeam because
of its strength, and the tree might get its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
name because from it was made the beam of wood
that goes over the horns.</p>

<p>Nowadays the wood is little used except for
making small things, such as handles of knives,
and spoons, and cog-wheels.</p>

THE HAZEL</h2>
</div>

<p>There are few of us who think of the Hazel
as one of our forest trees. We know it as a
large, straggling bush, with a thicket of leaves
and branches, among which are hidden delicious
nuts. But in some places the Hazel has quite
outgrown the bush stage: in Middlesex there is
a Hazel tree sixty feet high, with a straight thick
trunk and many large branches covered luxuriantly
with leaves.</p>

<p>The Hazel (1) has been known in history for
many centuries. The Romans wrote that its
spreading roots did harm to the young vines,
but they found its supple twigs invaluable for
tying up the straggling vine shoots.</p>

<p>Scotland is said to have been called Caledonia
from Cal Dun, which means the hill of Hazel.
And in Surrey we have the name Haslemere, which
tells its own story.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>In damp places beside streams, or on light
soil close to quarries, or among broken rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
ground, the Hazel thrives, and many are the
happy afternoons spent by children of all ages
gathering nuts in the Hazel coppice. This is
the only tree we have which produces food good
to eat in its wild state.</p>

<p>You will not find the Hazel difficult to recognise
at any time of year. Before the month of January
is over you will notice a pair of long brown caterpillars
dangling in the wind from many of the Hazel
twigs: lamb&#8217;s tails, the country children call them,
but their correct name is Hazel catkins; and like
those of the Birch tree, they have been hanging on
the tree all winter, but were so small that you did
not notice them.</p>

<p>In summer, if you look carefully, you find many
tiny green stamen catkins growing between the
foot of the leaf stalk and the branch. These
green cones grow very, very slowly all autumn
and winter, and when January is nearly over
they change into these dangling tails or hanging
catkins (3), and their tightly-folded scales
begin to unclose. Behind these scales lie eight
stamens, each of which has a bright yellow head.
These yellow heads are filled with fine powder,
and when ripe they burst, and the fine powder is
shaken out by the wind. Soon after, the catkin
turns brown and shrivelled, and before very long
it falls off; its work for the year is over.</p>

<p>When the snowdrops bloom, in the end of
January, the other Hazel flowers or seed catkins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
are ready. They are not easily seen, so you must
look for them carefully. On each side of the stalk
you will find a small scale-covered bud (4), and at
the tip of this bud rises a tuft of crimson threads.
Inside this scale-covered bud are the seeds, and
from the top of each seed rise two crimson threads.
On windy days the fine powder from the yellow
stamen heads is shaken over these crimson
threads, which carry it to the young seeds hidden
beneath the scaly covering. As spring advances
this crimson tuft disappears and the bud busies
itself making the seed, which must be ready
by autumn. The covering of the seed hardens
like a nut: at first this nut is pale green, but
in winter it becomes a glossy russet brown.</p>

<p>Inside this nut (5) lies the kernel of the seed,
and it is this sweet kernel which is the fruit we
eat. Meantime the scaly leaves, which formed
the covering of the young bud, have grown much
larger: they have become tough and leathery, and
their ends are deeply divided, as if they were torn.
In the Filbert Hazel, which is a cousin of the
common Hazel and very like it, these leathery
coverings conceal the nut. But in the common or
Cobnut Hazel they form a cup in which the nut
sits in the same way as the acorn does in its cup.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) of the Hazel appear in early
spring. They are rounded leaves, sometimes
slightly heart-shaped, and they have two rows of
teeth cut round the edge. Each leaf is rough and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
hairy, and is covered with a network of veins
which seems to pucker the leaf. At first the
young leaf stalk and branches are covered with
fine down, but this soon wears off. Notice how
many long, straight shoots rise from the ground
beside the Hazel roots. On these Hazel shoots
the leaves are placed in two rows on each side of
the shoot, with the leaves not opposite each other,
but alternate. The shoots make good baskets,
and hoops, and hurdles, because they can be so
easily bent into many shapes without breaking.
The branches of the Hazel bush have the same
good qualities, and they are valuable for fishing
rods and walking-sticks, and such purposes,
where toughness and elasticity are needed.</p>

<p>The Hazel leaves hang longer on the tree than
most other leaves. The frost changes their colour
from a dull grey-green to a pale yellow, but still
they cling to their stalks till the winter wind strips
them from the branches.</p>

<p>It is said that Hazel shoots or twigs have the
power of showing where water is concealed. In
places where there are no lakes, or rivers, or
streams near at hand, water is got by digging
wells deep down into the ground, and so allowing
the stores which are hidden there to rise to the
surface. But it is not everywhere that these
hidden supplies will be found, and as digging a
well costs a great deal of money, people are unwilling
to begin the work unless they are likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to succeed. So they send for a man who is called
a diviner, because he divines or guesses where
water will be found. He walks across the fields
carrying a Hazel rod in his hand, and when he
reaches a spot where water lies beneath, the
Hazel rod changes position in his hand and the
well is sunk at the spot which the diviner points
out. So the story goes.</p>

<p>For many generations it was a custom in this
country to burn Hazel nuts on the night of
October 31, All-Hallow Eve. Friends would meet
together late in the evening, and each person
would place two nuts as near together as possible
in a clear red fire. The nuts were supposed
to represent the two friends, and if they burned
quietly and evenly, then the future was sure to
be happy; but if they flared angrily or sputtered
hissingly, especially if they burst with a loud
report, then misfortune was supposed to follow
the friends.</p>

<p>Hazel nuts are eagerly devoured by squirrels
and dormice, and there is one bird, the Nuthatch,
that is very busy and grows sleek and
fat when the Hazel fruit is ripe. This bird breaks
off a nut branch and flies away with it to an old
oak tree. There he strips off the covering of
leaves and cleverly places the bare nut in a crevice
of the rough oak trunk. Then with his strong
bill he hammers at the shell till it breaks and he
can get at the nut inside. On still October days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in the quiet woods you will hear his bill tap-tapping
from the trunk of the oak tree.</p>

THE LIME OR LINDEN</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Lime, a summer home of murmurous wings.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright">&mdash;Tennyson.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The Lime or Linden (1) is one of the most
familiar trees in our large towns. It is very
hardy, and you find it planted by the side of our
smoky streets, where it seems to thrive in spite
of the clouds of sooty dust that cover its delicate
leaves.</p>

<p>But if you wish to know what a Lime tree
really looks like at its best, then you must find
one growing in some country park where there
is space, and fresh air, and plenty of sunshine;
then you will see how beautiful a tree it can be.
The Lime is a tall, stately tree. It has many
slender branches closely covered with leaves, which
have each a long stalk. In old trees the branches
often bend down close to the ground, but the
sunshine always succeeds in finding its way under
the Lime tree branches, and it flickers on the
grass as it never does beneath the Beech tree
boughs.</p>

<p>In winter the Lime tree is difficult to recognise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
although there is one feature you may notice: its
bare stems and twigs are very black against the
sky, and many of the branches hang so awkwardly
that they look as if they were dead. But go to the
park in spring, and at once you will know which
is the Lime tree. Every little twig is coloured a
delicate shade of olive green tinged with crimson,
and bears many small oval buds (3) which are red
like rubies. In May these ruby buds burst open,
and their crimson coverings fall to the ground,
disclosing the pale emerald-green leaf that is
tightly folded within. The leaves (2) soon open in
the sunshine, and you see that each is shaped like
a large pointed heart, and that the two sides of
the heart are uneven.</p>

<p>The edge of the leaf is cut into sharp teeth,
and all over it a network of fine veins is spread.
When the leaf is still young you find tufts of soft,
downy hairs on the under-side, and at first each
leaf hangs straight down from its stalk as if it
had not strength to rise and face the sunlight.
But they soon raise themselves, and gradually
their pale green colour darkens, though the Lime
tree leaf never becomes so dark, nor is it as
glossy, as the leaf of the Beech tree.</p>

<p>In September the Lime tree leaves turn pale
yellow: rather a colourless yellow, very different
from the rich gold and red-brown of the Beech,
and they fall with the first touch of frost.</p>

<p>You may sometimes find leaves which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
marked with large black, sooty-looking spots.
These spots are caused by a tiny insect which
has made its home on the leaf.</p>

<p>If you sit beneath the branches of the Lime
on a warm summer day you will hear the constant
hum of myriads of bees which are buzzing round
the tree. They are gathering honey from the
Lime tree flowers, whose delicious perfume is
scenting the air.</p>

<p>From the spot where next year&#8217;s leaf bud will
grow there hangs a long stalk; at the end of
this stalk there droops a cluster of flowers (4), and
at the base of each flower cluster stands a long
slender leaf called a bract. This bract looks
like a pale yellow wing, and is covered all over
with a network of fine veins.</p>

<p>The flowers have five greeny white petals and
five pale green sepals. In the centre is a small
seed-vessel like a tiny pea, and from it there rises
a slender green pillar which ends in five sticky
points. Closely surrounding this seed-vessel is
a ring of many stamens. Each stamen has a
white stalk with an orange-coloured head, and
among these stamens lie the drops of sweet juice
which attract the bees.</p>

<p>The stamen dust is ripe before the sticky
points of the seed-vessel on the same plant are
ready for it; but the bees, when they bend down
to suck the honey juice, brush against the ripe
stamen heads, and their backs become covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
with the fine powder. Away they fly to the
flowers on another Lime tree, and the powder
will probably be rubbed off on one where the
seed-vessel is ready to receive it.</p>

<p>When the seed is ripe you see many little downy
fruit-balls (5), each hanging from a slender stalk.
In warm countries this seed ripens into a small
nut which is ground down and made into a kind of
chocolate. But it never ripens in England.</p>

<p>In some countries there are large forests of
Lime trees, and the air is filled with the busy
hum of the bees. The peasants make large holes
in the tree trunks, and these holes the bees fill
with honeycomb, which the peasants easily remove
and sell. This Lime tree honey is much
prized for its fine flavour.</p>

<p>The wood of the Lime tree is not hard enough
for building purposes, but it is greatly in demand
for carving. It is light and soft, and much of
the beautiful wood decoration in our churches is
carved from Lime tree wood. It does not easily
become worm-eaten as do so many of our harder
woods.</p>

<p>We read that in old days the soldiers&#8217; shields
were made of Lime tree wood, as the blow of a
weapon was deadened when striking it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inner bark of the tree has always been
valuable. From it are made those mats of light
brown grass which gardeners use to protect
their delicate plants during winter; and these tails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of dried-looking grass with which they tie bunches
of flowers instead of using string, are also made
from the Lime tree bark. This inner bark is
called &#8220;bass&#8221; or &#8220;bast,&#8221; and is chiefly made
in Russia and Sweden.</p>

<p>It is from this bass or string that the tree gets
its name, which is not really Lime, but Line or
Linden, and is so called in other countries. We
in Britain have got into the bad habit of mispronouncing
the word. The true Lime tree is a
cousin of the Orange and Lemon trees, and bears
a yellow fruit called Limes. But the Linden
tree is no relation of this Lime tree, and is so
called because it is the tree from which we get
gardener&#8217;s dried string or line, and we must remember
that our popular name is a wrong one,
and not the true name of the tree.</p>

THE COMMON ELM AND WYCH OR
BROAD-LEAVED ELM</h2>
</div>

<p>There are two kinds of Elm which grow
abundantly in this country, and both are lofty,
noble trees. The Common Elm (1) you will
recognise easily, because its rough black trunk
is clothed right down to the ground with a dense
mass of brushwood. This brushwood is really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
a forest of small branches, and shoots, and twigs
which spring from the Elm tree root; and if you
separate some of these young shoots and plant
them alone they will grow into young Elm tree
saplings.</p>

<p>In winter you will always know the Common
Elm by its brushwood clothing, and in early
spring, in March, after there have been a few
sunny days, you will see tiny green leaf buds
opening in this brushwood sheaf before the large
upper branches show any signs of life.</p>

<p>The Common Elm is one of our tallest trees.
It has a thick rough trunk, on which are many
large gnarled bosses or knobs. The bark of the
tree is very rugged and is covered with many
deep furrows.</p>

<p>The branches of this Elm do not grow gracefully
in sweeping curves like those of the Ash
tree; they have a dwarf, zig-zag appearance, and
often they are twisted and knotted.</p>

<p>The young twigs that grow on these branches
are short and tiny, a network of little bushy
sprays growing close to the branch, and their
bark is downy and corky when it is young, but
becomes hard as the season advances.</p>

<p>In early spring these tiny twigs bear many
small scaly buds (3) like beads. These beads
open very early, before the end of April, and
from each there bursts a bunch of flowers (4).
What you notice first in this flower tuft is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
crowd of reddish stamens with large purple
heads. But if you gently pull to pieces one
of these flower bunches, you will find that the
stamens are not growing loose, but that they
are held together in groups of five or more, in
a dark green or purplish vase (5). This vase is
funnel-shaped, and widens out round the mouth
into four scallops. The oval seed-vessel (6) is
at the bottom, hidden from sight. Do not forget
to notice that in the Elm tree the stamens and
seed-vessel grow close together in one flower.</p>

<p>The stamens soon shrivel and fall off, and their
place is taken by bunches of flat green wings (7),
each with a tiny knob in the centre, which is the
fruit. These green shields, or wings, serve the
same purpose as the keys or wings of the Ash
tree. They are thin and light like paper, and in
the Common Elm each shield is deeply notched at
one end, almost to the centre seed.</p>

<p>When the seed is ripe the wind blows these
bunches of papery shields away from the twigs,
and they are carried long distances.</p>

<p>The Elm tree seed is almost ripe before the
leaves (2) begin to sprout. The leaf buds are pink
and downy, and the young leaves are folded fan-ways
inside. Each leaf has a short stalk, and is
small and narrow, with two rows of unequally-sized
teeth round the edge. These leaves are
rough and harsh above, with many hairs along
the centre rib, hairs like those on the Nettle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
which is a member of the same family as the
Elm, but these hairs, though they irritate, do not
actually sting. In October the leaves turn yellow,
and after a touch of frost they fall in showers.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will notice large black spots
disfiguring the leaves. These spots are caused
by a minute plant which makes its home on the
leaf and in the end destroys it. After the leaves
have fallen, they lie on the ground till spring
comes again, then this black plant increases
rapidly, and soon covers all the leaf, which quickly
decays.</p>

<p>Cattle love the Elm tree leaves when they are
green and young, and in some places they are
stripped from the trees in sackfuls to feed the
cows.</p>

<p>Many insects make their home on the Elm tree.
The caterpillar of the large tortoise-shell butterfly
feeds on the leaves, and there is an insect beetle
that burrows little tunnels in the wood and loosens
the bark from the tree. If you pick up some
pieces of Elm tree wood where a woodman has
been sawing, you will see curious markings like
the veins of a skeleton leaf, tunnelled in the wood.
These are made by a tiny beetle, and are very
injurious to the tree.</p>

<p>But the beetle has an enemy that comes to the
tree&#8217;s rescue. Sometimes on a still day if you are
sitting quietly in the woods, you will hear a gentle
tap-tapping close beside you. This is the woodpecker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a bird which is perched on the rough
bark of the Elm tree, and with his bill he pecks
at the tree in search of insects which form his
favourite meal.</p>

<p>Birds love the Elm trees, as their shade is not
too dense to shut out the sunshine, and you will
often find rooks&#8217; nests in the upper branches,
tossed and swayed by the gales.</p>

<p>The Elm tree is useful for many purposes.
Farmers plant it in their hedgerows, as grass
will grow freely above its roots.</p>

<p>In Italy the Elms are trained to carry the
Vines. The young trees have all their lower
branches cut off, leaving the bare stem like a
living pole; round this pole the slender vine is
twined, and its graceful trails hang in festoons
from the crown of Elm branches which are left at
the top of the pole to give shade. In poetry you
read of the Vine tree wedded to the common
Elm, which it clasps with its clinging arms.</p>

<p>Elm tree wood is very valuable as timber.
These rough bosses which grow on the trunk are
prized by cabinet-makers, who find the wood
curiously veined and streaked.</p>

<p>The inner lining of the bark is very tough, and
is made into ropes and garden string or bast, as
in the Lime tree. And the wood is sought for
all purposes where durability is needed; it lasts
well in water, and is much in demand for ship-building.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The Wych Elm or Broad-leaved Elm resembles
the Common Elm in many ways, but there are
several small differences you must note. There is
no brushwood sheaf clothing the base of the
Wych Elm trunk; it is bare and rough right
down to the ground. The leaves are larger and
much broader, resembling those of the Hazel, and
the branches of the Wych Elm are long and
spreading and much more graceful than the
twisted boughs of its sister Elm.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the green wings that
surround the tiny seed of the Wych Elm and
compare it with those of the Common Elm, you
will find that the seed lies nearly in the centre of
the wing, and that the notch which is cut at the
end of the wing is smaller than the deep notch of
the Common Elm.</p>

<p>The Wych Elm is far the more graceful of the
two trees, and it grows much more quickly than
its rugged sister.</p>

<p>The name Wych is supposed to be Scotch.
Small pieces of the wood were said to be effective
as charms against witches, and country dairy-maids
used to place a tiny bit of this Elm wood
in the churn so that the witches could not
prevent the milk from becoming butter!</p>

THE ASH</h2>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright">&mdash;Old Saying.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>If the Oak is well named the King of the woods,
to the Ash belongs the honour of being called
Queen, the wood&#8217;s fairest. She is a queen with
an ancient history. In the dim long ago there
must have been Ash trees, for we read that the
great spear of Achilles was an &#8220;ashen spear&#8221;;
also, that the gods held council under the boughs
of a great Ash tree: on its highest branches sat
an eagle; round its root a serpent lay coiled; and
a tiny squirrel ran up and down the branches
carrying messages from one to the other.</p>

<p>In much later times the Ash tree was held to
have magic powers of healing. Sick babies were
said to be cured if they passed through a cleft
made in its trunk; and there are many tales of
men and animals who recovered from illness on
touching an Ash twig gathered from a tree in
which a shrew mouse had been buried.</p>

<p>Nowadays we have grown so wise that we
think differently about these things, and we love
the Ash tree because of its beauty, and are grateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
for the many ways in which the wood is useful
to us.</p>

<p>You should try to find an Ash tree (1) in early
spring. It is one of the easiest trees to recognise
before it is clothed in leaves.</p>

<p>The trunk is very straight, and has none of the
knobs and bosses which grow on the Oak and
Elm tree trunks. When the Ash tree is still
young the bark is a pale grey colour&mdash;ash-colour,
we call it&mdash;and it is very smooth. But as the tree
grows older the bark cracks into many irregular
upright ridges, which remind you of the rimples
left by the waves on a sandy sea-shore.</p>

<p>At first the lower branches grow straight out
from the trunk, but soon they curve gracefully
downwards; then they rise again, and the tips
point upward toward the sky.</p>

<p>Notice the tips of these branches&mdash;they are quite
different from all other tree tips. In an Ash tree
you will not see a network of delicate branching
twigs outlined against the sky. Each branch
ends in a stout pale grey twig, which is slightly
flattened at the tip, as if it had been pinched
between two fingers when still soft. Beyond this
flattened tip you see two fat black buds (4), and
there are smaller black buds at the sides of the twig.
It is these curious black buds at the tips and on
the sides of the twig which will make it easy for
you to distinguish the Ash tree from every other.</p>

<p>Long after the other trees have put on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
young green leaves the Ash tree stands bare and
leafless, waiting till the frost and cold winds are
gone before its black buds will unfold. Then out
it comes, flowers first. The sooty buds at the
sides of the twig open, and you see that they
have dark brown linings, and that in the middle
of each bud there lies a thick bunch of purple
stamen heads (6), crowded together like grains
of purple corn; these are the Ash tree flowers (8).</p>

<p>Ash tree flowers have no petals and no sepals;
they have only a green, bottle-shaped seed-vessel
(7), which stands between two stamens with pale
green stalks and fat purple-coloured heads. Sometimes
there is not even a seed-vessel; you may
find nothing but a crowded bunch of purply
stamens. This latter kind of Ash tree cannot
produce any fruit.</p>

<p>In a few weeks these stamens shrivel and the
purple heads fall off. The seed-vessels, too, become
very different. They change into long flat
green wings, which hang each from its own stalk
in a cluster at the end or from the side of the
branch. These silky green wings are called
&#8220;keys&#8221; (3), or in some places, &#8220;spinners&#8221;; at one
end they are notched, and at the other, close to
the stalk, lies the fruit. Long after the Ash tree
leaves are withered and fallen you can see these
bunches of &#8220;keys,&#8221; grown brown and shrivelled,
still clinging to the branches. When wintry
weather comes they are torn off by the wind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the winged seed, spinning round and round in the
air, is carried a long distance.</p>

<p>You will see Ash trees growing high up on
rocky precipices, where only the birds or the
wind could have left the seed.</p>

<p>By the month of May, when the keys of the Ash
are fully formed, the green leaves (2) begin to
appear. They are beautiful feathery leaves, full of
lightness, and grace, and strength. Each leaf is
made up of from four to eleven pairs of leaflets,
shaped like a lance, with toothed edges, and these
are placed opposite each other on a central stalk:
there is nearly always a single leaflet at the end.
The leaves are pale green, and when they first
open you see a soft browny down on the leaf ribs,
but this soon wears off. They droop gracefully
from the twigs, which you can now see require
to be stout and strong to carry such large wind-tossed
feathers.</p>

<p>But the Ash tree leaves are among the first to
fall. Whenever the cold winds come they wither,
and a single night of frost will strew them in
hundreds on the ground. Where the leaf stalk
joined the twig you will see a curious scar (5)
shaped like a horse-shoe, and next year a black
bud will appear inside this scar. The Ash tree
will live for several hundred years. It is not
fully grown up till it is forty or fifty years old, and
till then you will not find any bunches of keys,
with their seeds, growing on the tree.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Notice that the ground beneath the branches
of the Ash tree is usually bare. Many of its roots
spread out to a great distance close below the
surface, and they are so greedy, and require so
much nourishment for the tree, that there is none
left for other plants. Some farmers think that
the raindrops which drip from the feathery Ash
leaves are hurtful to other plants, so they are
unwilling to plant Ash trees in their fields and
hedgerows.</p>

<p>The wood of the Ash is very valuable, and will
bring as much money as that of the Oak or Elm.
It is used for all kinds of work&mdash;for furniture and
for ship-building, and for making wheels and poles,
and it lasts well and does not readily split.</p>

THE FIELD MAPLE</h2>
</div>

<p>There are many mistakes made in naming the
Maple and Plane trees. The Sycamore or False
Plane tree, the Oriental Plane, and the Field
Maple are often called wrongly by each other&#8217;s
names. So you must note carefully the differences
between them. The Sycamore and the
Field Maple are cousins, but the Oriental Plane
is not even a distant relation of these, and only
resembles them in the shape of its leaves. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
not really difficult to distinguish one from the
other.</p>

<p>The Field Maple (1) is nearly always a small
tree which you find growing in the hedgerows,
where it is more like a large bush than a tree.
You rarely find it standing alone in a wide park,
bearing great branches heavily clothed with leaves,
as you find the Sycamore or Great Maple. In
England it is a common hedgerow tree, but it is
not native to Scotland and is seldom found there.</p>

<p>Early in spring you find the long slender shoots
covered with buds, from which burst small leaves
of a beautiful bright crimson colour. These leaves
(2) are toothed round the edges and are shaped
like a hand with five short fingers; in the
Field Maple the fingers are blunt at the points,
not sharp as are those of the Sycamore and of
the Oriental Plane.</p>

<p>As the spring advances those pretty crimson
leaves become dark green above and a light
green on the under-side, and they lose the soft
down which covered them, but even when
fully out they are never so large as those of the
Sycamore. When autumn draws near, with its
cold winds and frosty nights, the Field Maple
leaves change colour once more and become
brilliant yellow; you will see them shining in the
hedgerows like a bush of gold.</p>

<p>Many of the leaves are disfigured by small red
spots, and if you look at one of these spots with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
a magnifying-glass you will see that is caused
by a tiny insect which has made this little red
nest in which to lay its eggs.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Field Maple, like those of
the Sycamore, are placed opposite each other on
the twig; in the Oriental Plane they grow alternately,
one a little way above the other on opposite
sides of the spray. There is a great deal of
sugary juice in Maple leaves, and cattle love to
eat them. In some countries they are stripped
from the trees and kept for winter fodder for
the cows.</p>

<p>The bark of the Field Maple is noted for its
strange corky nature and its curious growth. It
grows in upright ridges, deeply furrowed, which
look as if they could easily be broken off. In the
Oriental Plane the bark is quite smooth, and it
peels off in large flakes, leaving patches of different
colours on the tree trunk.</p>

<p>In April, when the leaves are still unfolding,
the Field Maple brings out its spikes of flowers
(3). You will at once notice that these flower
clusters stand erect, and do not droop in pointed
tassels like those of the Sycamore. Now, look
at the flowers in an Oriental Plane, and you will
discover that they bear no resemblance either to
those of the Sycamore or of the Field Maple,
with which it is often confused. They do not
even grow in clusters, but in round, prickly balls
which are threaded on a slender green chain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>The flowers of the Field Maple are what
botanists call &#8220;perfect flowers,&#8221; which means
that each flower has all its parts complete within
itself. In every bloom you will find five narrow
green sepals and five narrow green petals; within
the ring of petals stand eight yellow-headed
stamens, and seated in the centre of the flower
is a seed-vessel with a small wing at each side
and with two curly horns standing up at the top.
There is plenty of honey juice hidden among these
stamens, and the bees buzz all day long around
the Maple blossoms.</p>

<p>As the season advances, the petals and sepals
and stamens fall off, but the seed-vessel grows
larger and larger, till you find bunches of winged
seeds (4) standing erect where the flowers once
grew.</p>

<p>Notice that in this tree the seeds are close
together beside the stalk, and that the wings
stand straight out from the seeds and are not
bent into the shape of the letter U, as they are
in the Sycamore. These bunches of winged seeds
are frequently tinged with bright crimson, and
are very attractive among the glossy green leaves.</p>

<p>In autumn the strong winds strip them from
their stalks and the wings bear the seed far
from the parent tree. Some botanists tell us
that these seeds require to lie in the ground for
more than a year before they begin to grow.</p>

<p>The Field Maple is full of sugary sap, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
nothing is made of it in this country, as the trees
do not yield enough to make it worth while. But
in Canada the sap is drawn from the trees and
made into sugar. I am sure you must have seen
the brown blocks of Maple sugar in the confectioners&#8217;
windows.</p>

<p>The wood of the Field Maple is too small to
be of much use, but it is strangely and beautifully
marked and veined with spots and stripes like
the skin of a tiger or panther, and is eagerly
bought for decorative purposes. The knots that
grow on the roots were said to be worth their
weight in gold, and in old history books you
read that the thrones of great kings were made
of Maple. Nowadays the wood is largely used
for making small articles such as plates, and
cups, and trays, and it can be cut so thin without
breaking that the light may be seen through it.</p>

<p>In France the long slender Maple shoots are
used for coachmen&#8217;s whips.</p>

THE SYCAMORE, OR GREAT MAPLE,
OR MOCK PLANE</h2>
</div>

<p>There is a good deal of confusion in people&#8217;s
minds as to the right name for this familiar tree.
Sycamore is not an English word, but is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
from a Greek word meaning fig or mulberry. The
tree has been so called because many years ago
people believed that it was a relation of the fig
tree which grows so abundantly by the roadside in
Palestine. The leaves are a little alike, but there
is no real resemblance between our English
Great Maple and the Eastern Sycamore: the
name has been given by mistake.</p>

<p>Another mistaken name given to this tree is
Plane tree. The Great Maple is only a mock
Plane tree or false Plane tree; it is not even a
relation of the real Plane any more than it is a
relation of the Fig or Sycamore. But mistakes
even in names are very difficult to correct, and
in many places, particularly in Scotland, you will
find that Sycamore (1) or Plane tree is the name
usually given to the Great Maple.</p>

<p>It is a large heavy tree, with a great central
trunk covered with a gnarled bark which peels
off in flakes, leaving patches of different shades.
From every side of this central trunk there grow
stout branches covered with masses of thick
foliage, the thickest and heaviest foliage of any
British tree.</p>

<p>If you look at the Sycamore tree as it stands
in an open field, or in a hedgerow, with grass
growing close to its very trunk, I think what
will strike you most is how evenly it has grown
all round. There are so many trees that grow
all to one side if they are much exposed to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
cold wind. Look at the Beech, or the Hawthorn,
or the Elm on the crest of a ridge, and you
will at once know from which direction the
wind blows strongest and coldest, by seeing how
the tree puts out all its best branches on the
sheltered side. But the Sycamore tree is indifferent
to cold, or even to the salt sea winds; it
sends out its branches equally on every side, and
there is always a thick roof of leaves at the top.</p>

<p>The Sycamore tree prefers a dry soil, in which
it grows very quickly; and it will not die if transplanted.</p>

<p>In early spring the twigs bear many large fat
buds (3), which are covered with soft downy pink
scales. The Horse Chestnut is the only other
tree which bears such large buds, but they are
dark and very sticky.</p>

<p>In country places the children call the largest
buds at the end of the Sycamore twig &#8220;cocks,&#8221;
and the smaller buds which grow along the sides
they call &#8220;hens.&#8221; When these buds open early
in May you see how beautifully the leaves are
folded fan-ways inside. Each leaf (2) is shaped
like a large hand with five bluntly-pointed fingers;
the edges are coarsely toothed, and the leaf is
dark green above and a paler green underneath.
They grow on long stalks, which are a reddish
pink colour so long as the leaves are young,
and each stalk is scooped into a hollow at the
end, so that it may fit closely to the twig.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>These leaves are not placed alternately on
opposite sides of the branch, as in the Beech or
Elm: they grow in clumps, or bouquets, and
each pair of leaves is placed cross-ways to the
pair above. Those that come out first have long
stalks and are the largest; then the second pair
is smaller, and the third pair smaller still, till
the bouquet is finished with two tiny leaves in
the centre.</p>

<p>Notice that the leaves of the Sycamore are
often marked with sticky drops. By old writers
these drops are called honey-dew. It is believed
that the sap of the Sycamore is sugary, and some
of this sugary juice escapes through the leaf
pores to the surface. These handsome leaves
are often spotted with small black dots, which
are caused by a tiny plant. This plant makes
its home on the Sycamore leaf, and unknowingly
disfigures its kind host.</p>

<p>Before the leaves are quite out the flowers
appear. They grow in drooping spikes (4), or
large tassels of a pale yellowish green colour.
Each tassel is made up of many separate flowers,
and most of these flowers have a calyx with five to
twelve narrow strap-shaped sepals, and a corolla
of the same number of yellow-green petals.
There is also a ring of slender stamens standing
round a flat green cushion or disc. In the centre
sits the seed-vessel, which has two curved horns at
the top. But in the flower tassel you may also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
find flowers in which some of the parts are awanting:
one flower will have stamens, but no seed-vessel,
and its neighbour will have a seed-vessel
and no stamens, while in a third the petals may be
awanting. You must examine each flower till you
find one which is perfect. These Sycamore flowers
contain much honey, nearly as much as those of
the Lime tree; and the bees are glad to hover
round the tree flowers, which blossom long before
those in the meadow are open.</p>

<p>After the flowers are withered the seed (5)
develops wings like the Ash and the Elm. But
these wings are very different from those of any
other tree. They are shaped like the letter U,
with the two seeds at the bottom of the letter
where it joins the stalk. Each seed is like a
small pea, and is snugly packed in a horny case
lined with the softest and silkiest down. When it
is ripe the wind blows the winged seeds from the
tree and carries them a long way. They fall into
the ground, where the horny case prevents the
young seed from rotting during the cold winter
months before it is time for it to begin to sprout.
Then when spring comes the baby seed bursts its
covering and sends up two tiny green ribbon
leaves which are the beginning of a new Sycamore
tree. The wings of the Sycamore seed
are beautifully tinged with pink.</p>

<p>The wood of the Sycamore or Great Maple is
white and very soft, but it is closely grained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Sometimes you see big knobs on the tree trunk
where a branch has died or been broken off, and
cabinet-makers prize these knobs, as the wood is
very curiously marked with beautiful veins and
streaks. Maple wood will polish as smooth as
satin, and the backs of violins are often made of
it. In old books we read of table-tops that were
made of curiously marked pieces of Maple, and
it is told that more than eight hundred pounds
was given for one of these Maple tables.</p>

<p>In Scotland the Sycamore tree was often called
the dool tree, or tree of mourning, because the
nobles used to hang disobedient servants or
vanquished foes on its strong branches; and at
Cassilis, in Ayrshire, there is a Sycamore tree
which is well known to have been used for this
cruel purpose.</p>

THE ORIENTAL PLANE</h2>
</div>

<p>There are two kinds of Plane tree which have
come to us as strangers from foreign lands and
have taken kindly to our cold climate and biting
winds. These are the Oriental or Eastern Plane
and the Occidental or Western Plane. The differences
between them are not great, and the one
which you will most easily remember is, that in
the Oriental Plane the leaf stalk is green, whereas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
in the Occidental Plane tree it is purply red. We
owe a special debt of gratitude to these Plane
trees because they add beauty to so many of the
dingy streets and squares in our big cities.</p>

4. Seed Flower Balls<span class="gap">5. Fruit</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The trunk of the Oriental Plane (1) is very
smooth, and is usually ash-grey in colour; sometimes
it is a very dark green. The outer layer
of this trunk peels off in flakes, leaving large
patches of greenish yellow, and these give the tree
a curious speckled appearance. It is a tall, handsome
tree, and if you look at it from a distance
you see that the broad leaves group themselves
into large masses with a wide space between each
mass. This you can only see in a full-grown tree,
and such trees are rarely met with in our dusty
towns.</p>

<p>On account of its leaves the Oriental Plane tree
is frequently confused with the Sycamore, so
you must notice carefully wherein they differ.
The leaves (2) of the Oriental Plane are shaped
like a hand with five sharply-pointed fingers, and
each finger is cut all round into sharp teeth. The
leaves are very smooth, and light, and fine, and
are as thin as paper. They will lie quite flat
if you lay them on a table. Each leaf is placed
alternately with its neighbour on the twig, the
second leaf growing on the opposite side of
the twig, but a little further up than the first
leaf. In the Sycamore you remember that the
leaves grow in pairs placed exactly opposite each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
other, and that the second pair is always placed
cross-ways to the first pair? These Oriental
Plane leaves are so smooth that the rain easily
washes all dust and soot from them, and this is
why this tree manages to live in a city better
than those which have crinkled, or hairy, or
sticky leaves, which catch and keep the choking
dust.</p>

<p>In most trees the leaf buds are to be found
growing between the base of the leaf stem and
the twig which supports it. You will find no
trace of such buds in the Oriental Plane; they
are carefully hidden, and are tenderly protected
in a marvellous way.</p>

<p>You see that the base of the leaf stalk is considerably
swollen, and that round it there is a
line? If you gently pull the leaf, it will come apart
from the twig at this line, and then you will discover
that the swollen part of the leaf stalk is
hollow, and is fitted like a cap over the tiny leaf
bud, which is cosily sheltered within. This baby
leaf bud is very sensitive to cold, and has many
wrappings as well as the leaf cap. Its outer case
is lined with sticky gum, which keeps out any
damp; then come many small scales covered with
soft fur, and inside these lie the tiny leaves,
wrapped in a quilt of soft, silky down. This silky
down is golden-brown in colour, and it remains
on the young leaf till it is quite grown up. Sometimes
the young buds are tempted by bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
sunshine to throw off their winter coverings too
soon. Then if biting frost comes they all die, and
the tree will bear no more buds that year. The
Plane tree gets its name from a Greek word
which means a shield, and this name was given
because its broad, flat leaves cast a very welcome
shade in hot Eastern lands.</p>

<p>In winter it is easy to recognize the Oriental
Plane by its curious seeds. Hanging on the bare
branches are strings of round bristly fruit-balls (5),
three or four, or even five, threaded like large
beads on a long slender chain. There are no
seed balls such as these on the Sycamore tree,
nor on its cousin the Field Maple.</p>

<p>These seed balls are very interesting. Early
in spring you see them dangling in the air, and
you must pluck one of the green chains and
examine its round beads. In one ball are grouped
together bunches of purple stamens (3), which
have a few pointed, dry scales at the base of
each group. As soon as these stamens are ripe
and their pollen dust has been blown away, these
balls shrivel and fall off. But close beside them,
on a similar green chain, are dangling the seed
balls (4). Inside these balls there is a soft green
cushion, and all over this cushion are stuck small
green seeds shaped like pears, each with a tiny
point like a stalk standing up at the top. After
the stamen dust has fallen on these seeds they
enlarge into a small hard nut, and a tuft of bristly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
down grows up from the base of each seed. The
ball becomes a dark brown colour, and it dangles
all winter on the tree; then in spring, when the
leaves are ready to burst their coverings, these
brown balls fall to the ground and the dry seeds
are blown away, each seed floating in the air
by the aid of its bristly down.</p>

<p>In America these Eastern and Western Plane
trees are called Button trees, because the seed
balls resemble old-fashioned buttons.</p>

<p>The wood of the Oriental Plane is used by
piano-makers, coach-builders, and cabinet-makers.
It is a light brown colour, and is said to be very
tough.</p>

THE WHITE POPLAR OR ABELE TREE</h2>
</div>

<p>In the old Greek legends we read that Hercules
won a victory over Kakos on Mount Aventine.
On the mountain grew a thick grove of Poplar
trees, and Hercules, overjoyed with his triumph,
bound a branch of the graceful leaves around
his brow as a sign of victory. Soon afterwards
he went down into the infernal regions, the place
of tears and gloom, and when he came back to
earth it was seen that the upper side of his leafy
garland was darkened with the smoke of Hades,
but that the under-side of the leaves had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
washed silver white with the sweat which streamed
from his brow. Ever since that day the leaves
of the Aventine Poplar grow white on the under-side,
and in course of time its seeds were brought
by travellers to Britain, and the tree has taken
kindly to our less sunny land. So the tale runs.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is by these dark green leaves with their thick
white lining that you will always know the White
Poplar or Abele tree (1), and when you learn how
many relations it has, and how closely they resemble
each other, you will be glad to have this
marked distinction by which you may easily know
this member of the family.</p>

<p>The Poplar, like the Willows, prefers to grow
in damp places. The most perfect trees are found
in meadows close to a river. In France the
people plant them along the river banks, and
from far away you can trace the windings of the
water by the tall Poplar spires which edge its
banks.</p>

<p>The Poplars are very fast-growing trees; they
will shoot up to a great height in the life-time of
a man, and for this reason they are often planted
where a screen is quickly required. The lower
part of the trunk is dark and is deeply furrowed,
but the upper is a dingy yellow colour, and on it
there are many black streaks.</p>

<p>Early in March the White Poplar begins to
flower. It is one of the catkin-bearing trees, and
high on the upper branches there dance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
dangle long slender woolly tails of a purplish red
colour. These are the stamen catkins (4), and
you must pick one to pieces and see how beautifully
it is made.</p>

<p>The stamens are grouped together in little
bunches of from eight to thirty on a round disc,
and at the foot of this disc, on one side, rises a
scale which is green on the lower half and reddish
brown on the upper half. This scale is deeply
and irregularly toothed all round the edge, and
is surrounded with fine silk which stands up
like a fan. These bunches of stamens are placed
all round the catkin tail, with the scales nearly
covering the purple stamen heads. As soon as
the pollen dust in the stamen heads is ripe and
the wind has shaken it out of their dust-bags, the
catkin shrivels and falls to the ground. You will
find the ground strewn with them in early spring.</p>

<p>But the White Poplar has another catkin
flower which bears the seeds, and this flower
grows on a separate tree. These seed catkins (3)
are stouter and shorter, and are not nearly so
noticeable as the long stamen catkins. The
green seed-vessel sits in a tiny cup, and on the
top of the seed you see a cross of four yellow rays.
On one side of the cup rises a scale which is
brown at the upper edge and is fringed with down
as in the stamen catkin. The wind brings the
stamen dust to the four yellow rays on the top
of the little seed-vessel, but if there should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
no stamen-bearing trees growing near, then the
White Poplar can produce no new seeds; it
remains barren.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) of the White Poplar are triangular
in shape and are deeply jagged all round. When
in bud the sides of the leaf are rolled towards the
centre, so that the under-side of the leaf, with its
thick white lining, is turned outward. The young
branches and buds are also thickly covered with
fine white down.</p>

<p>The Poplar leaves never seem to be still; they
dance and sparkle in the sunshine, and even on
quiet days you will see them fluttering. In
autumn these leaves turn golden yellow before
they fall.</p>

<p>The wood of the White Poplar is too quickly
grown to be very durable. It is largely used for
making children&#8217;s toys, because it does not readily
split when nails are driven into it. It will not
burn easily, and for this reason it makes good
floors for dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>Besides the White Poplar or Abele tree there
are two other Poplars which are fairly common in
this country. One is the Lombardy Poplar, which
grows tall and slender like a church spire; its
branches rise upward like the flame of a torch, and
the tree trunk is clothed to the very ground with
withered branches, which never spread outwards,
but grow close to the main stem. There is no
difficulty in recognising the Lombardy Poplar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The Black Poplar is also common in many parts
of Britain. Its leaves are not lined with white;
they are heart-shaped, with no jagged edges, but
with dainty little teeth cut evenly all round. The
heads of the stamens, which grow in groups on
the catkin tail, are very dark purple, and they hang
from the end of twigs, which are rough with the
scars of last year&#8217;s leaves.</p>

<p>The Aspen (1) is a member of the Poplar
family, and in many ways it resembles its cousins.
But you will always know an Aspen tree by
its leaves (2). These are never still unless when
a storm is brooding and the air is perfectly
calm; at all other times they shake and quiver
incessantly, and you can hear the gentle rustle
they make as each leaf rubs against its neighbour.
In the Scottish Highlands the country
people tell you that the Aspen trembles because
at the Crucifixion the cross of Christ was made
of Aspen, and the tree must always shudder at
the recollection of the cruel purpose it served.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Aspen is usually found growing in copses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
or in meadow lands, where it flourishes best in
a damp soil; but it is also found on mountain
ground, and is very common in the north of
Scotland. It is not a long-lived tree: the heart
of it begins to decay after fifty or sixty years,
just at the age when many of our most familiar
trees are at their finest. The wood is very soft,
and is of little use either for building or for
manufacturing purposes; but it is beautifully
white, and sculptors use it for decorative carving;
also many of the wooden blocks required by
engravers for printing are made of Aspen wood.</p>

<p>The Aspen is one of our catkin-bearing trees.
Early in spring you will see dangling on the
branches long fluffy tails, which you must pluck
and examine carefully. There are two kinds of
flowering catkins on the Aspen, and both kinds
may be found growing on the same tree. Sometimes
you find them close beside each other on
the same branch.</p>

<p>In the stamen catkin (3) you see many bunches
of tiny stamens with bluey-purple heads: these
bunches are dotted all over the catkin tail, and
each stamen bunch is nearly hidden by a large
scale which rises at one side. This scale is green
in the lower half and pale brown in the upper half,
and its edges are cut into deep jagged points.
This jagged scale lies above the stamen bunch,
so that you can just see their heads appearing
under the torn edge of the scale. Each stamen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
is surrounded by a mass of soft grey woolly
down, which makes all the catkin look fluffy
and silky.</p>

<p>The seed catkin (4) of the Aspen looks much
the same as the stamen catkin; it is a long, dangling
fat tail, covered with fluffy grey down; but it
has no stamens. This catkin bears the seed-vessels,
and each seed-vessel resembles a small
green pea sitting in a tiny green cup. This pea
splits open at the top, and you see four pale pink
points rising from the opening. These points are
waiting for the stamen dust to reach them, and as
soon as that happens they shrivel and disappear;
then the seed busies itself in preparing the new
plant. Above each green seed-vessel there stands
a scale with the edge cut into large torn-looking
points. These scales nearly cover the seed-vessel,
and they look like brown splashes on
the bed of soft fluffy down.</p>

<p>When the seeds are ripe the catkins fall from
the tree; the seeds separate from the tail, and
the wind blows them a long distance by the aid
of the fluffy down which surrounds each seed.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Aspen leaves (2) are very dainty and pretty.
Each leaf grows at the end of a long slender
stalk which is flattened like a ribbon, and is
placed edge-ways to the twig. The stalk is
not strong enough to hold the leaf upright, so
it droops, unless when the breeze lifts it in the
air, and then you hear a constant rustle-rustle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
as if the leaves were whispering to each other.
These Aspen leaves are nearly round, and they
have evenly-cut teeth on the edges. They are
rather small and are dark in colour, and there
is no white lining underneath except the soft
down which you often find on very young leaves,
and which soon disappears.</p>

<p>Through the grass beside its root the Aspen
sends up a great many young shoots which are
called suckers. The leaves on these young
suckers are heart-shaped, and the edges are quite
smooth, without any teeth.</p>

<p>Cattle are very fond of these young leaves, so
are deer, and goats, and even the beaver. In
some places people strip the Aspen leaves from
the trees and give them to the cattle, which eat
them greedily.</p>

THE WHITE WILLOW</h2>
</div>

<p>To distinguish different members of the Willow
family is very difficult. It contains many brothers
and sisters who are so much alike that you would
require to study nothing but willows for many a
day if you wished to know each from the other.</p>

<p>In this book are described three different
Willows. The first is a lofty tree with a thick
trunk and spreading branches; the second is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
usually a bushy mass of slender twigs bending
over the river bed; and the third is a small
creeping shrub which twines itself among the
roots of the heather, and carpets the ground with
masses of silky down. And I think if you know
well these three kinds of Willow, you should be
able to group the other members of the family
around them.</p>

<p>The White Willow (1) is the name given to the
largest Willow tree, and very beautiful it is in
early spring when the leaves unfold. It has a
thick trunk covered with rough, rugged bark, and
it sends out large branches, from which grow many
smooth, slender twigs. The leaves (2) appear
about the middle of May, long narrow leaves
which taper to a point, and from a distance you
would think that the edges were quite smooth.
But when you pick a leaf you find that there are
dainty little teeth cut all round the edge. These
narrow leaves are covered on both sides with a
silky grey down; this gives them a pale, silvery-grey
colour, and from a distance you can easily
recognise a White Willow tree by the glistening
of this beautiful grey foliage, so different from the
vivid young green of the Larch and the yellow-green
of the Limes and Sycamores.</p>

<p>The White Willow produces two kinds of
flowers, and these grow in catkins on different
trees. The stamen catkins are the prettiest,
and they appear about the same time as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
young leaves. At first these stamen catkins are
small egg-shaped buds, closely covered with silky
grey down&mdash;pussy buds (3) the children call them;
but they open very quickly, and in a few days you
will see, dropping from the branches, small green
catkins which curl slightly like caterpillars. Each
catkin is covered with closely-shut scales, and by
the time the leaves are out the scales of these
stamen catkins unclose (4). Behind each scale
there rises a pair of stamens on long slender stalks.
These stamen stalks are hairy on the lower half,
and so are the catkin scales. The heads of the
stamens are sometimes tinged with red, and between
each pair of stamens there lies a honey bag.
Notice how constantly the bees are heard buzzing
among the Willow branches. When the stamen
heads are ripe they burst open, and the fine dust
inside is carried by the wind to a Willow tree, on
which the seed catkins grow.</p>

<p>These seed catkins (5) are covered with greenish
scales, which are tightly pressed together at first.
But in the warm spring sunshine the scales unclose,
and from the foot of each scale rises a
small green pear-shaped seed-vessel which has two
tiny straps standing up at the top. The wind
wafts the stamen dust to the tree, and some of
it falls on these two small straps, which act as
messengers and carry the dust down to the inside
of the seed-vessel, where the plant makes ready
the new seed. Unless you have a seed-bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
tree and a stamen-bearing tree growing within
reach of each other, you cannot have any new
seeds; but it is possible to increase the number of
Willow trees by cutting off branches and planting
them in a particular way in the ground, when they
will send out roots and grow.</p>

<p>There are two other kinds of White Willow
which are found nearly as frequently as the one
I have just described, and neither is difficult to
recognise. The Golden Willow is the name
usually given to one, on account of its twigs, which
are a bright shade of yellow-green, and these
golden twigs are very noticeable in winter beside
the dark branches of the Elms and Beeches. In
this Willow the stamens and scales of the dust-producing
catkins are the colour of a canary&#8217;s
feathers, and in the spring sunshine they glisten
like gold. This is the loveliest of all the Willow
trees.</p>

<p>The third White Willow is known as the Crack
Willow, because the branches are very easily
broken; a knock will snap them from the tree
trunk. If ever you try to gather a twig from
other Willow trees, you will find how difficult it
is to separate it from the branch. The thin green
peel, with the leaves clinging to it, comes away
in your hand, leaving the bare white twig still
clinging to the branch, and without a knife you
will scarcely force them apart. But the twigs
of the Crack Willow may be snapped across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
easily, and the large branches are readily broken
on a windy night.</p>

<p>The wood of the White and of the Golden
Willow is valuable, and is much used by builders
for floors and rafters. Coopers say it makes
excellent casks, and many of our best cricket bats
are made from Willow wood. When straw is
scarce people are said to make hats from Willow
sprays. They gather the small branches and
split them into long, thin strips, and these are
woven into fine plaits, which are then joined
together.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>The second Willow or group of Willows you
should learn about is the most difficult of all.
In it there are many different varieties, and you
would require to plant one of each kind in your
garden, as a gentleman in England has done,
and study them carefully for many years to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
discover the points wherein each Willow differs
from the other.</p>

<p>Though the Goat Willow or Sallow (1) sometimes
grows into a tall tree, it is more often seen
as a bush&mdash;a bush with a short, rough stem, which
does not rise far above the ground, and which
sends up many tall, slender branches, covered
with smooth, purplish brown peel or skin. Early
in March, before the snowdrops have withered,
you will find the Goat Willow in every hedge
and coppice bursting into scaly brown buds. It
is one of our earliest trees, and after a few days
of warm sunshine the brown scales unclose and
the branches are dotted with the softest and
silkiest little pussy buds (3), shaped like tiny eggs
and covered with grey down.</p>

<p>These buds grow alternately on the smooth
stem with a small space between each bud. In
a few days the baby buds have changed, and you
may find two Willow bushes growing quite near
each other on which the buds are very different.
For those woolly buds are the flower catkins, and
the Goat Willow bears two kinds of flowers, which
do not grow on the same tree.</p>

<p>The bees have found out that the Willow is in
flower; you can hear a swarm of them buzzing
in the leafless branches, and you wonder where
there is any honey to be found. On one tree the
soft grey downy buds have grown larger, and they
are now golden yellow catkins (4). The whole bud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
is covered with dainty yellow-headed stamens,
nestling in pairs among oval scales edged with
silky down, and it is at the base of these yellow-headed
stamens that the bee finds the sweet
drops of honey juice.</p>

<p>For many hundreds of years branches of the
Goat Willow or Sallow have been carried in
this country to church on Palm Sunday in remembrance
of the branches of palm which the
people strewed in front of Christ when He
entered Jerusalem. Troops of boys and girls
go into the country lanes and coppices to gather
Willow-palms, which they sometimes pluck so
roughly and carelessly that the tree remains
broken and ruined for the rest of the year. These
silky stamen catkins of the Goat Willow are one
of the most welcome signs of the return of spring.</p>

<p>But there are other Willow flowers to be looked
at: flowers which may not be so attractive, but
which bear the seeds and make ready the new
plants. These flowers are silky too, and underneath
the soft down is an egg-shaped catkin
(5), covered with small pear-shaped green seeds.
Each seed has a thick yellow point at the top,
and at the base there rises a scale which
is pointed like a cat&#8217;s ear and is covered with
long, silky hairs. When the stamen flowers are
ripe their yellow heads burst, and the fine dust
which fills them falls on the backs of the bees
who are sipping the honey juice. Then they fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
away to find another honey flower, and they
often alight on a seed catkin, where the pollen
dust is shaken off among the little yellow points
which are waiting for it to help in the making of
the new seeds. Each flower catkin sits upright
on a tuft of small pale green leaves.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) of the Goat Willow are very
different from those of the other Willows; they
are broad and oval, with edges which are crinkled
or waved all round and with a network of fine
veins covering the leaf. These leaves, when they
first come out, are covered with white down,
but by the time they are full grown they are
dark and shiny on the upper side, and are only
downy beneath.</p>

<p>There is another bushy Willow which perhaps
you might mistake for the Goat Willow or Sallow:
this is the Purple Osier. It grows in boggy
marshes, by the banks of slow-running streams,
and it too has silky grey catkins. But you will
easily recognise the Purple Osier by two things.
It has long, slender stems like whips, rising
straight from the tree trunk. These slender
stems are covered with a fine purple skin or peel,
and if you try to pick an Osier stem the peel comes
away in your hand, leaving the white Willow stem
still growing. These Osier stems are valuable for
making baskets, and are grown in great quantities
for this purpose.</p>

<p>The second point in which the Purple Osier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
differs from the Goat Willow is this: if you
gather a yellow catkin and look at the yellow-headed
stamens which cover it, you will see that
the slender stalks of the stamens are joined
together, making one stalk with two yellow heads,
whereas in the Goat Willow or Sallow each
yellow stamen head sways at the end of its own
stalk.</p>

<p>There is one other Willow tree I should like to
tell you about, because it is so curious. It is a
tree which creeps close to the ground, and which
is found growing in great quantities in the
Highlands among the grass and heather. It
is called the Dwarf Willow, and it too has
silky catkins which grow on the tough wiry
branches.</p>

<p>You might not notice these stamen catkins, but
you could not help noticing the seed catkins.
These cover the ground with tufts of white cotton
wool like thistle-down, and when you lift one of
these tufts you find that the pear-shaped green
seed-vessels have split down the centre to allow
many tiny seeds to escape, and each seed is winged
with a tuft of silky down. After all the seeds
have flown away on the wind, the withered seed-vessels
still remain on the catkin, no longer green,
but a rusty red-brown colour, which is very
noticeable among the small glossy green leaves.</p>

THE SCOTCH PINE OR SCOTCH FIR</h2>

<p>The Scotch Pine (1), or, as it is often called by
mistake, the Scotch Fir, is one of our noblest
trees; it is tall, and rugged, and sturdy, with a
beauty which lies in its strength and dignity rather
than in its grace. In bygone days large tracts
of Scotland were clothed with vast forests of
Scotch Pine, under whose gloomy branches many
wolves roamed and the wild deer wandered in
herds. But the owners of these noble forests cut
down the trees to get money for the timber, and
the wolves have disappeared. There is now only
a scanty remnant of the great army of Pine trees
which once clothed the northern lands of Britain.</p>

<p>Those vast forests were not planted by man.
The young trees sprang from seeds which had
fallen from the woody fruit cones, and were
carried by rooks or other birds to places where
human beings rarely trod. There the young
seeds grew and sent out their greedy roots. If
the soil was good and plentiful they produced a
strong carrot-shaped root, which bored deep into
the ground and gave the tree such a firm hold
that no storm could tear it up. But if the ground
had only a little earth on the surface and there
were hard rocks beneath, then the roots crept
like serpents near the surface of the soil, clasping
the rocks with a tight grip to steady the tree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>How the wind roars in the Pine branches on
the high mountain lands! It is like the sound
of the sea. If the Pine tree had broad leaves,
such as the Sycamore or the Lime tree, it would
soon be blown down; but the storm gusts pass
through its fine needle-leaves, and no harm is
done.</p>

<p>The trunk of the Scotch Pine is very rough,
and it is covered with rugged pieces of reddish
bark, separated from each other by deep furrows.
It rises to a great height, throwing out many
large branches on each side, and there is always
a bushy rounded tree-top looking up to the sky.
In a Pine forest the lower part of the tree is
usually bare. This is because the trees are
planted so close together there is little air except
near the top of the tree, and the lower branches
are stifled.</p>

<p>Beneath the branches the ground is always
carpeted with fallen Pine leaves, and very curious
these Pine leaves (2) are. They look like green
needles with soft blunt points, and the edges of
each needle are rolled back so that the leaf appears
round above and is boat-shaped below.
The under-side of the needle is much lighter in
colour than the dark green surface.</p>

<p>These needle-leaves usually grow in pairs,
though you may find a bunch containing three or
even four needles; they are held together by a
thin grey sheath, which looks like paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
clasps the end of the bunch. These needle-bunches
are placed all round the twig, close together,
so as to form a dense brush. They remain
on the tree for two or three years, then they fall;
but their work is not done. Very often the Pine
tree seed has been carried to some sandy sea-shore
upon which nothing is willing to grow. There it
takes root and flourishes, and in course of time it
throws down handfuls of withered needle-leaves on
the loose sandy ground. These needles decay and
form a bed of soil which binds the sand together,
and when the wind and the birds bring other
seeds, they find a place in which they can take
root and grow. In France great tracts of waste
land have become valuable in this way through
the planting of Pine trees.</p>

<p>The Pine tree has its flowers in catkins and
its fruit in cones. The catkins are of two kinds,
and they grow on the same tree, sometimes on
the same branch. The stamen flowers (3) are
found in dense spikes at the end of last year&#8217;s
bushy twig. They look like a cluster of bunches
of small yellow grains from which a tuft of fine
green spears rises in the centre. These grains
are the stamen heads, and in May and June they
send out clouds of fine yellow powder, which floats
in the air and settles on the leaves and on the
grass and on the margins of lakes and rivers,
where you can see little patches of it lying.
Country peasants sometimes tell you that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
yellow powder is sulphur which has fallen from
the sky during a thunder-storm!</p>

<p>The seed flowers (4) of the Pine tree are very
different. They grow either singly or in pairs at
the end of this year&#8217;s new twig, and at first they
are tiny pale pink cones. These cones are egg-shaped,
and are made up of scales tightly pressed
together, with little hard dots showing at the tip
of each scale. The seeds are behind the scales,
but you will not see them for a long time, as the
cone takes eighteen months to grow up. At the
end of the first summer you find that the pink
cone has become a rich green colour (5) and is
still soft, but when the second summer comes
round, the cone is ash-grey in colour (6) and is
hard and woody.</p>

<p>When the seeds are ripe the tightly-pressed
scales unclose and curl up, showing thick wooden
lips; at the base of each scale lie two white seeds,
and each seed (7) has a thin filmy wing. When
the seeds fall from the cone they are blown long
distances, floating on the air by their filmy wings.</p>

<p>There is a bird called the crossbill which is
very fond of Pine seeds, and very clever at picking
them out of the half-opened cones.</p>

<p>You will occasionally find a tree, very similar to
the Scotch Pine, in which the cones grow in
groups of three or four together at the end of the
twigs. This tree is called the Cluster Pine, and
you will notice that its bunches of leaves are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
different in colour: they are a bluey green, and
the tips of the needles are yellowish, as if they
had begun to wither.</p>

<p>The wood of the Pine tree is very valuable.
Thousands of pounds were paid for the trees in
the old Scotch forests, and many stout ships were
built from their sturdy trunks. Besides the good
timber, the Pine tree gives us turpentine and
resin from its juice. If you cut a hole in a Pine
tree stem a thick juice will soon be seen oozing
from this hole, and it quickly hardens into a clear
gum.</p>

THE YEW</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time a discontented Yew tree grew
in a country graveyard. Other trees, it thought,
had larger and more beautiful leaves which
fluttered in the breeze and became red and
brown and yellow in the sunshine, and the Yew
tree pined because the fairies had given it such
an unattractive dress. One morning the sunshine
disclosed that all its green leaves had changed
into leaves made of gold, and the heart of the
Yew tree danced with happiness. But some
robbers, as they stole through the forest, were
attracted by the glitter, and they stripped off every
golden leaf. Again the tree bemoaned its fate,
and next day the sun shone on leaves of purest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
crystal. &#8220;How beautiful!&#8221; thought the tree; &#8220;see
how I sparkle!&#8221; But a hailstorm burst from the
clouds, and the sparkling leaves lay shivered on
the grass. Once more the good fairies tried to
comfort the unhappy tree. Smooth broad leaves
covered its branches, and the Yew tree flaunted
these gay banners in the wind. But, alas, a flock
of goats came by and ate of the fresh young
leaves &#8220;a million and ten.&#8221; &#8220;Give me back again
my old dress,&#8221; sobbed the Yew, &#8220;for I see that it
was best.&#8221; And ever since its leaves remain
unchanging, and it wears the sombre dress which
covered its boughs in the days when King William
landed from Normandy on our shores, and the
swineherd tended his pigs in the great forests
which covered so much of Merry England.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>In history books we read how important the
Yew tree once was. Long before the invention
of guns and gunpowder, many of our soldiers
carried bows made of Yew tree wood, and from
these they shot deadly arrows with tremendous
force. Three of England&#8217;s Kings&mdash;Harold, William
Rufus, and Richard C&#339;ur de Lion&mdash;were slain
by such arrows, and it was from a Yew tree bow
that Tell sent the arrow that halved the apple
placed on his son&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>The Yew tree (1) grows very, very slowly; it
never becomes a tall tree, not even when it has
lived hundreds and hundreds of years, because,
instead of sending up one thick trunk, it has the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
strange habit of dividing into a cluster of trunks,
three or four or more of equal thickness, which
rise from one root. These trunks are covered
with browny red bark and are very smooth; the
red bark peels off in thin flakes, and you can see
that the wood beneath it is a deep orange red.</p>

<p>From the clustered trunks many branches
stretch out to form a densely bushy tree; these
branches are closely covered with small twigs, on
which grow short narrow leaves (2), ending in
blunt points, and with the edges slightly curved
backwards. These leaves grow alternately all
round the twig, and they are dark and glossy
above but much paler beneath. They do not fall
from the tree in winter, as the Yew, like the
Holly, is one of our evergreen trees. Yew tree
leaves are very poisonous, and many tales are
told of cattle and horses which have died from
eating them.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the Yew tree is planted
in churchyards because it is poisonous and is
associated with death; while others think just
the opposite, and say that it is placed among the
tombstones to remind us that the soul is undying,
like the Yew tree leaves.</p>

<p>In February or March if you strike a Yew tree
bough with a stick you will see clouds of fine
yellow powder rising from the tree. This powder
is the stamen dust, and if you pull a spray of
leaves and examine it you will discover clusters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of small oval yellow flowers (3) nestling close
to the main stem where the leaf joins it.
The Yew tree belongs to the great family of
trees whose fruit is a cone and which bear
their flowers in catkins. Take a magnifying-glass,
and it will show you that each catkin
is composed of a bunch of stamens rising from
a slender pillar at the foot of which are a few
dry, papery scales. Each stamen has six dust-bags
at the end, and when the stamen powder
is ripe these dust-bags open, and the fine yellow
powder is blown like meal over the leaves and
seeds.</p>

<p>The Yew tree has seed flowers (4) as well as
those which bear the stamens. Usually they
grow on a different tree, but occasionally you
will find them on the same Yew, but on a
separate branch. It is a curious thing about
the Yew tree and its relations that these seeds
are not covered in any way, but lie naked to
the sun and rain. They always grow on the
under-side of the stem, and at first they look
like tiny acorns. You notice a small disc surrounded
by a few scales, and on this disc sits
the little green acorn with its olive green skin.
This acorn is waiting for the stamen dust to reach
it. As soon as the wind has blown the yellow
powder over it a beautiful cup of pale pink wax
grows round the green seed. There is no hard,
woody cone on the Yew tree; the fruit (5) is this pale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
pink waxen berry, shaped like a fairy cup and
filled with sticky juice. The walls of the pink cup
are soft and fleshy, and you can just see the tip of
the green seed standing up in the centre. They
are very lovely, these waxy pink berries on the dark
green spray, but they are said to be poisonous.</p>

<p>Sometimes at the end of a Yew spray there
grows a curious-looking cone like a small artichoke,
made of soft green leaves. This is caused
by a tiny gnat which lays its eggs in a Yew tree
bud, and in some strange way that we do not
understand causes it to develop this tuft of
strange leaves. You will remember that in the
Oak a similar growth is found.</p>

<p>The wood of the Yew tree is very hard and
durable, as are all woods which grow slowly.
&#8220;A Yew tree post will outlast a post of iron&#8221; is a
saying often repeated by farmers; but the Yew
wood is not much in demand for manufacturing
purposes.</p>

THE JUNIPER</h2>
</div>

<p>In the Bible we read that when Elijah fled from
the cruel persecution of King Ahab and the wicked
Queen Jezebel, he sat down under a Juniper tree
to rest. When we look at the Juniper as it grows
in this country, we wonder how the prophet could
have found rest beside such a prickly tree, or shade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
beneath such a small one. But in other lands the
Juniper grows much taller; and as all books about
trees give it a place beside its relations the Yew
and the Scotch Pine, it must be included among
the common trees you should learn to know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Britain the Juniper (1) is found on heathy
commons or high on the upland plains, where it
flourishes as a large, thick, bushy shrub, and
occasionally shoots up into a small tree. It is
rather a gloomy-looking tree: in spring time,
when most of our trees look fresh and bright in
their young green leaves, the Juniper shows little
change. Its leaves are evergreen, and the new
leaves grow in small tufts at the tips of the
branches, so that you scarcely notice them.</p>

<p>The Juniper bark is dark reddish brown, and
it flakes off in small pieces in the same way as
the Yew tree bark. The branches are small and
thin, and they clothe the trunk close to the very
ground; it would be difficult to sit comfortably
under a Juniper tree in this country. Like the
Yew, it is a very slow-growing tree.</p>

<p>Juniper leaves (2) are not in the least like
ordinary leaves: they are more like thorns than
leaves, and they are not easy to gather. But if
you examine a spray carefully you will find that
each leaf is like a narrow flat spear with a sharp
point at the end. Each leaf has a slight groove
cut from end to end in the upper side, which is
dark green, very smooth and glossy. Notice how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
curiously the leaves are grouped on the spray. They
are placed in incomplete circles of three, and there
is always a short space between each of the circles.</p>

<p>Juniper flowers are of two kinds, and they
usually grow on separate trees, though sometimes
you may find both kinds on separate branches of
the same tree. The stamen flowers (3) are in full
bloom in May, and you will find them growing in
small scaly catkins close to the foot of the leaf
where it joins the stem. The heads of the
stamens stand like a row of small yellow beads
along the edge of each scale, and when they are
ripe the beads burst and the leaves around are
covered with their fine yellow powder.</p>

<p>The seed flowers (4) also grow at the foot of the
leaves, and at first you might mistake them for young
buds. They have thicker and more fleshy scales
than those of the stamen catkins, and after the
yellow stamen dust is blown by the wind on to their
seed-vessels the upper scales grow into a green
berry (5). These green berries remain in the tree
all through the winter, and the following summer
they change into a deep purplish black. Each
berry has a soft grey bloom all over it, like the
bloom on a grape.</p>

<p>These berries are very bitter to taste, but are not
poisonous; in some illnesses country people use
them successfully as a medicine.</p>

<p>Many are the uses of the Juniper, and in olden
days it was highly valued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>In Sweden the berries are eaten to breakfast;
sometimes they are roasted and ground into
coffee.</p>

<p>The wood and its berries may be burnt in sick-rooms
to purify the air and refresh the patient.
Country people believed that burning sprays of
Juniper kept away witches, and the smoke was
supposed to drive away serpents, as well as to
destroy any germs of plague or other infectious
disease.</p>

<p>In Scotland the smoke from a Juniper fire is
used for curing hams.</p>

<p>In Lapland the peasants make ropes from the
Juniper bark, and they tell you that if a bit of
Juniper wood is lighted and then carefully covered
with ashes it will keep alight for a whole year.</p>

<p>The trunk of the Juniper tree is too small and
slight to be very useful as timber; but good
walking-sticks are often made from the branches
and young stems.</p>

THE LARCH</h2>
</div>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;When rosy plumelets tuft the larch.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright">&mdash;Tennyson.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>The Larch (1) was brought to Britain in the
seventeenth century from its home on the high
mountains of Germany, Austria, and Italy. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
has taken kindly to our cheerless climate, and now
covers acres of what was once barren moorland.</p>

<p>A few years after Larches are planted the long
flexible branches of the young trees meet and
form a thicket into which little light or air can
enter, and the weeds and heather growing round
the tree roots are stifled. Each winter the Larch
sheds on the bare ground millions of its tiny
needle-leaves, which enrich the soil.</p>

<p>After the young trees have grown to a certain
height the forester thins the plantation; he cuts
down a number of the young trees, so that those
which remain may have more room to grow, and
he removes all the withered branches near the
ground. This allows the sunshine to reach the
soil, and soon after a crop of soft, fine grass is
seen carpeting the ground. Sheep and cattle
can now be pastured where a short time before
there grew nothing but heather and weeds.</p>

<p>Look at a Larch plantation in winter time, and
you will think that all the trees are dead. The
Pines and the Firs are resting, and the Oaks
and Beeches seem asleep, but their branches do
not have the dead, withered look of the Larch
trees. Come again early in spring, and you will
see a wonderful change. These dead twigs are
now a pale glossy brown, so glossy that they
might have been varnished. Try to pull one, and
you will find how tough and sound it is; only
where the twig joins the branch can you separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
it from the tree; and what a delightful smell of
turpentine remains on your fingers after gathering
the Larch twigs!</p>

<p>In the trunk of this tree there are stores of
turpentine, tiny lakes of it, which are of considerable
value. In Italy, where the Larch trees
grow to great size, small holes are bored through
the trunk to the very heart of the tree, and a thin
pipe is put in. Then a can is hung on the end
of the pipe, and the pure turpentine juice drops
steadily into the can. It is then strained, and is
sold just as it comes from the tree.</p>

<p>Early in April the Larch tree begins to get
ready for summer; it is always one of the first
trees to awaken at the call of spring. On each
flexible twig there appear little brown scaly knobs
like small beads, placed either singly or in pairs
with a short space between each bead. In a few
days these scaly beads burst open, and a tuft of
vivid green leaves (2), like the fringes round the
mouth of a sea-anemone, peeps out. These leaves
are soft and flat and slender, very different from
the hard needles of the Pine and the harsh
swords of the Fir trees, and they grow in tufts,
thirty or forty together, rising from the centre
of the scaly brown bead. Each tuft is of the
brightest green. So the Larch tree is a very
vision of spring in the dark Fir plantations, while
the leaf buds of many other trees are only awakening
from their winter sleep.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>In the hedgerows the Hawthorns are in full
leaf, the stamen flowers cluster on the boughs
of the Elm, and the Hazel and Willow catkins
dangle their tails in the wind; but the forest
trees remain sombre and gloomy, and the young
Larch seems gay as the sunlight among them.
As the season advances the Larch tree leaves
become darker, and they fall early in winter.
We have only one other cone-bearing tree which
is not evergreen, and that is the Cypress.</p>

<p>After the leafy tufts appear you will notice that
some of the scaly brown beads have not produced
any leaves; instead they have become tiny oval
catkins (3), which are made up of a crowd of small
yellow grains. These catkins are the stamen
flowers, and in the yellow grains, which are the
heads of the stamens, is prepared the dust powder
which the seed flowers require to assist them in
getting ready the new seed.</p>

<p>On the same twig, and not far from the stamen
catkins, you see a beautiful deep rose-red seed
catkin (4). This tiny rose-red catkin is very lovely
among the brilliant green tufts of leaves; no other
cone-bearing tree has anything so attractive to
show us. At first the catkin scales are soft and
fleshy; they overlap each other very loosely, and
from the base of each scale there rises a bright
green point like a single needle-leaf.</p>

<p>In a few weeks the catkin has become a young
cone (5), which looks like a small rosy egg sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
erect on a bent footstalk, then the rose-pink colour
fades from the cone, and the scales become hard
and woody. Behind each scale lie two tiny white
seeds with wings, and there is a coating of sticky
resin over these seeds to keep them dry. The
ripe cones (6) remain on the tree for years, long
after the seeds have been blown away on their
transparent wings by the wind.</p>

<p>The crossbill often builds his nest in a Larch
tree. He is particularly fond of Larch tree seeds,
and is very clever at picking them out of the ripe
cones.</p>

<p>The trunk of a full-grown Larch is reddish
brown in colour, and it is covered with a rough,
scaly bark, which is often hung with hoary tufts
of pale grey lichen.</p>

<p>Larch wood is very valuable, and is used for
many purposes. It is very tough, and does not
rot in water. Joiners tell us there are fewer knots
in planks of Larch than in those of either Silver
Fir or Spruce. Wood knots are scars which
occur where a dead branch has fallen from the
tree, and builders complain that when the tree
is sawn into planks, the knots shrink and fall out,
leaving a round hole. This reduces the value of
the wood; but in the Larch planks the knots are
said not to come away from the surrounding
wood.</p>

THE SPRUCE FIR</h2>
</div>

<p>Although the Scotch Pine is sometimes called
the Scotch Fir, the latter name is generally
admitted to be a mistake. It was given long ago
by people who had not seen the real Fir trees,
and who did not know how different they are from
the Pines. It is several hundred years since the
Spruce Fir was brought to this country, but it
is not one of our native trees, like the Scotch
Pine, the Yew, and the Juniper.</p>

<p>The Spruce (1) is one of our tallest trees; it
loves to grow on ground many thousand feet
above the level of the sea; and in Switzerland and
Norway there are great forests of these slender,
soldier-like trees, clothing the sides of the giant
snow mountains. With us it does not grow so
abundantly, but you will find many Spruce Firs
mingling with the Scotch Pine in the large woods
of our Scotch Highlands.</p>

<p>The Spruce Fir has a very straggling root
which does not penetrate far into the ground;
it creeps along close under the surface, and intertwines
itself with any other tree roots in the
neighbourhood. This does not give it a very firm
hold, and after great gales you sometimes find
a broad path opened in the Fir woods, which has
been made by the Spruce trees falling in the track
of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>It is a very straight tree, with a smooth scaly
bark of a reddish brown colour; from each side
of the trunk slender branches grow straight out
like the spokes of a wheel; but each branch rises
a little way above the last as the steps rise in a
ladder. These branches are very slender, and at
first they sweep downwards in graceful curves;
but at the tips they all turn upward, so that the
points look toward the sky.</p>

<p>The branches get smaller and smaller as the
tree grows higher, which gives it the appearance
of a pyramid, and at the very top there stands a
single upright branch like a spear. This spear-like
tip is one of the distinctive features of the
Spruce Fir.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) are short and flat and hard, and
they are rather prickly to touch. They do not
grow in pairs or bundles, as in the Scotch Pine or
the Larch; they are placed singly and very close
together all round the twig. The twigs grow
almost opposite each other on the young sprays,
and each spray hangs straight down from the
main branch, which looks as if a parting had been
made along its centre and the sprays combed
evenly to either side. From a distance the Spruce
tree branches resemble drooping feathers which
curve skyward at the tips.</p>

<p>The Spruce Fir has two kinds of flowers. In
May or June, if you look at the tips of the drooping
sprays which grew last year, you will see two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
or three little oval catkins of a pretty yellowish
pink colour nestling among the hard, flat leaves.
These are the stamen flowers (3), and when ripe
they will burst open and scatter a great deal of
yellow pollen dust.</p>

<p>The seed flowers (4) grow in cones, and are
found at the end of this year&#8217;s shoots. It is by
these cones you will most readily recognise the
Spruce Fir. You remember that in the Scotch
Pine the full-grown cones were grey and woody,
with tightly-pressed lips, and that these lips were
very thick and curled upwards when the cone
opened?</p>

<p>In the Fir trees the scales of the ripe cones (5)
are like thin glossy brown paper. Each scale
ends in two sharp little teeth, and the scales are
not tightly pressed together, but overlap each
other loosely, so that you could put the blade of
a knife under each. The woody cones are always
found in Pine trees, and the papery cones are
characteristic of the Firs.</p>

<p>In the Spruce Fir these cones are about six
inches long, with blunt tips, and when full grown
they hang from the sprays. Do not forget to
notice this, as in some Fir trees the full-grown
cones are seated upright on the branches. Under
each scale there lie two little seeds (6), with large
pale brown wings; these seeds require over a year
to ripen, then the wind blows them from the
loosened cone scales to many a strange resting-place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
where they take root, and a new tree begins
to grow.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may see strange leafy-looking
bunches (7) like soft, badly-made cones on the
young sprays. These are caused by an insect
which lays its eggs in the young leaf bud and
destroys its graceful shape.</p>

<p>The Spruce Fir has two enemies that do it
great harm. These are the crossbill and the
squirrel. They break off the young shoots close
to the end, and so stop the growth of the branches.
You will often find the ground strewn with these
fresh green twigs; but you require to sit very still
for a long time if you wish to see the enemies
at work.</p>

<p>The wood of the Spruce Fir is valuable for
many purposes. The tall, smooth tree trunks are
used for the masts of ships, for scaffolding poles,
and telegraph posts; and many boat-loads of Fir
planks are brought from Norway and from the
shores of the Baltic Sea, to be manufactured into
flooring boards for our houses. In some places
the fibre of the Spruce Fir is reduced to pulp,
and from this a common kind of paper is produced
which is used for newspapers or cheap
magazines.</p>

<p>From the sap we get resin and turpentine, and
the bark is used in the tanning of leather.</p>

<p>Some people say that the name Fir wood is just
a mistake for fire-wood, because in the old days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
torches were made of the young fir branches,
whose gummy twigs burnt easily with a clear,
strong light.</p>

THE SILVER FIR</h2>
</div>

<p>Many people find it difficult to distinguish between
the Spruce Fir and the Silver Fir, and
they are often called by each other&#8217;s names; yet
they are unlike in many points, and a little trouble
would prevent such mistakes.</p>

<p>The Silver Fir (1) is not one of our native trees;
it was brought from Central or Southern Europe
to this country in 1603, and has taken kindly to
our moist climate. It does not grow on such
lofty mountains as the Spruce, but it will thrive
at a level of six thousand feet above the sea,
higher than the highest mountain in Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is a tall, stately tree, but it is bushier and
less regular than the Spruce Fir. The trunk is
covered with greyish brown bark, which is smooth
when the tree is young; but as the tree grows
old&mdash;and the Silver Fir will live for four hundred
years&mdash;this bark cracks into many rugged fissures.
You remember that the Spruce tree has a sharp
spear-like point rising from the very top of
the trunk. In the Silver Fir the tree is only
pointed when very young, and by the time it is full
grown the top is bushy, with many small unequal
branches standing out from the main stem.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>These branches do not grow in whorls or circles,
like the spokes of a wheel; they are often irregular,
and there may be gaps in the tree where
a branch has fallen off, and only a scar is left to
show where the branch should have been. The
Silver Fir is a firmly-rooted tree; it sends a long
tap-shaped root, ending in two forks, deep into
the soil, so that there is little danger of the wind
uprooting it during the wintry gales.</p>

<p>Now look at the leaves (2) which grow on the
Silver Fir. Like those of the Spruce, and unlike
those of the Pine, they grow singly, each little
leaf standing by itself on the rough twig. Although
they are placed all round this twig, these
leaves have a tendency to grow to right or left
of the twig, and look as if they had been parted
down the centre and carefully combed to each
side.</p>

<p>Each leaf is flat and slender, and on the upper
side it is a dark glossy green; the edges are
rolled back on to the under-side of the leaf, which
is much paler in colour. The centre rib of the
leaf is much raised, and looks like a slender cord,
and on each side of this cord, between it and the
curled-back leaf edge, there runs a silvery white
line; it is from this silvery line that the tree gets
its name.</p>

<p>Notice that the leaf twigs of the Silver Fir
do not droop in the feathery way they do in the
Spruce; they are much stiffer, and stand out all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
round the branch; also, there is not nearly such
a marked upward curve at the tip of the branch
as you find in the Spruce Fir. The leaves of the
Silver Fir remain on the tree eight or nine years,
but each year the tree lengthens its sprays, and
the young leaves are a beautiful pale yellowish
green colour, almost as pale as the young leaves
of the primrose.</p>

<p>The stamen flowers (3) grow at the ends of the
young sprays. They consist of a few overlapping
scales with a cluster of stamens inside. The seed
flowers or cones (4) grow on the same tree, sometimes
on the same branch, and they become cones
in the same way as the seed flowers of the Pine
and the Spruce. But you will at once notice a
difference. The cones of the Silver Fir grow upright;
they sit on the branches with their tops
looking up to the sky, whereas the cones of the
Spruce and the Scotch Pine when full grown
hang down from the ends of the spray with their
tips pointing to the ground. If there are any
cones visible you will never mistake the Silver
Fir for the Spruce.</p>

<p>The ripe cones (5) are made up of many thin, soft
scales which overlap each other closely, and each
scale ends in a sharp point which turns backward;
this gives the cone a hairy appearance.
At first the cones are green, like those of the
Scotch Pine, but soon they turn purple, and when
quite ripe they are a rich red-brown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>If the tree is old enough&mdash;that means if it is forty
years of age&mdash;you will find small angular seeds (6),
with a long filmy wing attached, nestling behind
each scale. But if the tree is still young, the
cones are seedless. It takes eighteen months
for the cone to ripen, and when the seeds are
ready and they and the red-brown scales fall from
the cone, a bare brown stick is left standing upright
on the branch.</p>

<p>The wood of the Silver Fir is very valuable, and
it is used for many purposes; doors and window-frames
and floors are constantly made of it, and
for ship-building it is in great demand. In Switzerland
there are great forests of Silver Fir, but they
grow high on the mountain sides, where there are
no roads and no means of getting the trees brought
down after they are felled.</p>

<p>But at Lucerne, a town on the shores of a large
lake, with great forests on the mountains above,
the people invented an excellent way of overcoming
this difficulty.</p>

<p>A narrow avenue was cut in the forest among the
trees, and this was floored with trunks of Fir and
Spruce. Snow and water were poured down this
avenue, which the cold air quickly froze, and the
avenue became a gigantic ice-slide eight miles
long. The Fir trees were felled, and all their
branches lopped off, the bare trunks were placed
on this slide, and in six minutes they shot into
the waters of the lake eight miles below. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
they floated till the wood merchant was ready for
them.</p>

<p>The Silver Fir tree is rich in gummy juice, which
is made into turpentine and resin. Have you ever
seen necklaces of pale cloudy beads, and of clear
dark brown made of amber? People tell us this
amber is found on the shores of the Baltic Sea, and
that it is just the gummy juice which dropped long
ago from some kind of Fir tree and has hardened
in a mysterious way of which we know nothing.</p>

THE HOLLY</h2>

<p>The Holly (1) is our most important evergreen,
and is so well known that it scarcely needs any
description. It has flourished in this country as
long as the Oak, and is often found growing under
tall trees in the crowded forests, as well as in the
open glades, where lawns of fine grass are to
be found.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>People say that the Holly, or Holm tree, as it is
often called, is the greenwood tree spoken of by
Shakespeare, and that under its bushy shelter
Robin Hood and his merry men held their meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
in the open glades of Sherwood Forest. Sometimes
it is called the Holy tree, because from the
oldest time of which we have any record its
boughs have been used to deck our shrines and
churches, and in some parts of England the
country people in December speak of gathering
Christmas, which is the name they give to the
Holly, or Holy tree. It is this evergreen which
we oftenest use at Christmas-tide to decorate
our churches, and very lovely the dark green
sprays, with their coral berries, look when twined
round the grey stone pillars.</p>

<p>The Holly is looked upon as a second-rate forest
tree. It is never very large, and it usually appears
as a thick, tall bush, with many branches reaching
almost to the ground. Sometimes you find it with
a slender, bare trunk, clothed with pale grey bark,
and if you look closely at this bark you will see
that it is covered with curious black markings, as
if some strange writing had been traced on it with
a heavy black pen.</p>

<p>This writing is the work of a tiny plant which
makes its home on the Holly stem and spreads in
this strange way.</p>

<p>The bark of the young Holly shoots and boughs
is pale green and quite smooth.</p>

<p>The tree requires little sunshine, and it seems
to keep all it gets, as every leaf is highly polished
and reflects the light like a mirror. These leaves
grow closely on every branch; they are placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
alternately on each side of the twigs, and are
oval, with the edges so much waved that the
leaves will not lie flat, but curl on each side of
the centre rib.</p>

<p>The prickly leaves (3) which grow low down
on the tree have sharp spines along the waved
edges, and a very sharp spine always grows at
the point of the leaf. But the upper branches
are clothed with blunt leaves (2) which have no
spines along the edges; instead there is a pale
yellow line round each leaf, and there is a single
blunt spine at the point.</p>

<p>Sheep and deer are very fond of eating the tough,
leathery leaves of the Holly, and it is believed that
the tree clothes its lower branches in prickly leaves
to protect itself from these greedy enemies.</p>

<p>Country people tell you that if branches of
smooth Holly are the first to be brought into the
house at Christmas-time, then the wife will be head
of the house all the next year, but if the prickly
boughs enter first, then the husband will be ruler.</p>

<p>The Holly leaves hang on the tree several years,
and after they fall they lie a long time on the
ground before the damp soaks through their
leathery skin and makes them decay. You will
find Holly leaves from which all the green part
of the leaf has disappeared, leaving a beautiful
skeleton leaf of grey fibre, which is still perfect
in every vein and rib.</p>

<p>The flowers (4) of the Holly bloom in May.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
They appear in small crowded clusters between
the leaf stalk and the twig, and each flower is a
delicate pale pink on the outside, but is pure white
within. There is a calyx cup edged with four
green points, and inside this cup stands a long
white tube, with four white petals at the top.
There are four yellow-headed stamens, and a tiny
seed-vessel is hidden inside the flower tube.
Sometimes all these parts will be found complete
in a single flower; sometimes there will be flowers
on the same branch which have stamens and no
seed-vessel, and others which have seed-vessels
and no stamens. Perhaps you will find a whole
tree on which not a single seed flower grows.
This tree may be laden with lovely white flowers
in spring, but it will bear no berries in winter.
You must have both stamen flowers and seed
flowers if the tree is to produce any fruit.</p>

<p>As summer passes, the seed-vessels, which have
had stamen dust scattered over them, become
small green berries (5), and these berries turn
yellow and then change into a deep red, the
colour of coral or sealing-wax. The berries
cluster round the green stalk, and most beautiful
they are among the glossy dark leaves. Inside
each berry there are four little fruit stones
containing seeds, and the birds love to eat these
red berries, which are full of mealy pulp; but
remember that children must never eat the Holly
berries, as they are poisonous except for the birds.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>You will find that if the Holly tree has a good
crop of berries this winter there will not be many
the following year; the tree seems to require a
year&#8217;s rest before it can produce a second large
crop.</p>

<p>There are some Holly trees with leaves which
are shaded with pale yellow or white&mdash;variegated
Hollies, we call them. These are greatly prized
for planting in gardens, where the bushes with
different-coloured leaves lend much beauty when
all the trees are bare in winter.</p>

<p>The wood of the Holly is too small to be of
much use. It is white and very hard, and when
stained black it is largely used instead of ebony,
which is scarce and expensive. The black
handles of many of our silver teapots are made of
stained Holly wood. A sticky lime, which is used
for snaring birds, is made from the young green
shoots and twigs, and the slender branches are
good for making walking-sticks and coachmen&#8217;s
whips.</p>

THE WILD CHERRY OR GEAN</h2>
</div>

<p>There are now more than forty varieties of
Cherry in Britain, and they all are descended from
the Gean or Wild Cherry tree. This favourite
tree belongs to the great Rose family, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
related to the Apple, and Pear, and Plum. It
grows freely all over Britain except in the very
north of Scotland; and we read that six hundred
years ago the county of Kent was famous for its
Cherry orchards.</p>

1. Wild Cherry or Gean in Autumn<span class="gap">2. Flower Cluster with Leaves</span><span class="gap">3. Fruit</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Germany the Cherry is planted for many
miles by the roadsides, so that all passers-by may
eat the fruit and enjoy the shade cast by the tall
trees. And if there should be any particular
tree whose fruit the owner does not wish taken,
he ties a wisp of straw round that tree, and the
people understand the sign and do not touch
these Cherries.</p>

<p>In France the Wild Cherry fruit, along with a
little bread and butter, is often the only food of
the poor charcoal-burners and wood-cutters, who
stay in the forest during the cold winter months.</p>

<p>Song birds, especially the blackbirds, love to
eat cherries, and as we are very grateful to the
birds for eating the many grubs and insects which
destroy our fruit and corn, we must not grudge
them a feast from our Cherry trees. It is probably
the birds who have carried the seeds to the many
different places where we find Cherry trees springing
up.</p>

<p>The Wild Cherry (1) is a tall tree with wide-spreading
branches. It has a smooth grey bark,
from which you will often see oozing large drops
of clear gum. This gum is very sticky, it will not
melt in cold water, and it is very difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
remove from your fingers. The Wild Cherry
leaves (2) appear in spring, long oval leaves ending
in a point, and with sharp teeth along the edge.
These leaves are very soft, and they droop from
the twigs. At first the leaf is folded lengthways,
with the two edges meeting, and it is a dull brown
colour; but this colour soon changes in the sunshine
to a soft green, and when autumn comes
you find leaves of every shade of pink and red
and crimson.</p>

<p>The large white Cherry blossoms (2) come
almost at the same time as the leaves, and they
grow in loose clusters, in which the flowers hang
from the end of long, drooping stalks. There are
always many small leaf-like scales where these
flower stalks join the twig. Each blossom has
a pear-shaped calyx at the end of the flower stalk,
and this calyx is edged with five green points.
These points fold back against the stalk after
the flower is withered.</p>

<p>There are five large snowy petals which make
the flower clusters look very lovely in the spring
sunshine, but the petals fall very quickly and
strew the ground with their snowy flakes.</p>

<p>Within the petal circle there are many slender
stamens, and you can see a long red-tipped point
rising from the seed-vessel, which lies concealed
in the pear-shaped calyx which stands beneath
the petals and sepals.</p>

<p>The Wild Cherry fruit (3) is black, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
dark red. It is rather sour, and the cherries we
buy in the shops are usually cherries which have
been cultivated in an orchard, and have been grown
in a warmer country.</p>

<p>In Cambridgeshire there is a festival called
Cherry Sunday, when every one goes to the Cherry
orchard, and on paying sixpence may eat as many
cherries as he pleases.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the cuckoo has
always been associated with the Cherry tree.
There is an old proverb which says, &#8220;The cuckoo
never sings till he has thrice eaten his fill of
cherries&#8221;; and country children play a delightful
game in which he has a part. They join hands
and dance round a Cherry tree, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="first">&#8220;Cuckoo, Cherry tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Come down and tell to me,</div>
<div class="verse">How many years I have to live.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then each child shakes one of the Cherry tree
branches, and the number of cherries that fall tell
him how many years he will live. If five cherries
fall he has five years to live, and if twelve cherries
fall he will live twelve years, and so on.</p>

<p>There is a cunning little bird called the woodpecker
which very often visits the Cherry tree. He
eats the insects that live on its bark; and you can
hear his bill peck, pecking at the trunk as he
picks up his food.</p>

<p>The wood of the Cherry tree is hard, yet easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
worked. It is much in demand by furniture makers,
and is a rich red colour which can be highly
polished.</p>

THE WHITEBEAM</h2>
</div>

<p>In the old Saxon language, which was once the
language spoken by most of the people in England,
the word beam means a tree, so we must be
careful not to speak of the Whitebeam tree, as
that would be just the same as to say the White
tree tree.</p>

<p>The Whitebeam (1) is not nearly so common as
the Oak, or the Ash or Beech, and yet it has been
known in this country for many hundred years.
It is found growing stiff and tall on bleak chalky
pastures as well as in beautiful parks and plantations.
The trunk is covered with a rough
brown bark, and there are great deep roots which
spread widely and keep the tree firmly attached
to the soil.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption">THE WHITEBEAM<br />


1. Whitebeam<span class="gap">2. Flower Cluster with Leaves</span><span class="gap">3. Fruit Cluster with Leaves</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is easy to see why this tree is called the
Whitebeam. Look at the fat buds which have
been on the tree all winter, making you think that
spring was close at hand. In April these buds
burst open, and you see that the young leaves
inside are covered with a thick coating of woolly
down. They are the woolliest buds which grow
in this country, and the leaves (2), when they first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
come out, are as white as if they had been
sprinkled with flour. They are pretty leaves,
broad and oval, with large teeth cut all round the
edge and with clearly-marked veins. At first
each leaf is white above as well as below, but as
it gets older the woolly down disappears from the
upper side, and the leaf becomes a dark, glossy
green. But watch the tree some day when the
wind is stirring, and at every gust the dark green
leaves blow upwards and sideways, and you will
see that the back of each leaf is silvery white&mdash;the
woolly lining has remained. You remember
that the white Poplar or Abele tree had leaves
which were white-lined too.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Whitebeam (2) resemble
those of the Rowan, but they are larger and are
not so closely clustered together on their short
stalks. Each flower has five pointed green sepals
standing out like the rays of a star beneath the
circle of five white petals. There is a ring of
delicate stamens with yellow heads within the
petal circle, and the seeds are concealed in the
pear-shaped swelling which supports the flower
at the end of the flower stalk. There are often
dark spots on the main flower stem from which
all the smaller ones branch.</p>

<p>After the white petals and the stamens have
fallen off, the swollen flower stalk enlarges and
becomes an oval berry (3), considerably larger
than that of the Rowan. At first the berries are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
covered with white down, but soon that wears off,
and you see that the berries are smooth and are a
rich red colour. They are not good to eat, these
attractive-looking berries, though people say they
are pleasant when over-ripe and ready to decay.
But the birds love them, and so do hedgehogs
and squirrels.</p>

<p>In France the people plant a great many Whitebeams.
This is because the small birds require
the berries for food in the winter, when there are
no longer grubs and insects to be found. These
grubs and insects destroy the vines and corn
when they are young and tender in early spring,
and the small birds are needed because they eat
these pests, and so save the young plants.</p>

<p>The wood of the Whitebeam is not much used,
though small objects, such as wooden spoons,
knife handles, and combs, are made of it. It is
very hard, and will take a high polish.</p>

<p>The Rowan tree is closely related to the roses,
and is a cousin of the Hawthorn, the Apple, and
the Pear. It is not related in any way to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Ash, but the leaves have some resemblance, because,
like the Ash tree leaves, they are made up
of many pairs of small leaflets growing opposite
each other on each side of a centre stalk, and
with an odd leaflet at the end. But the leaflets
of the Ash tree have each a stalk; those in the
Rowan have none, and in the Ash tree each large
feathery leaf is planted exactly opposite its neighbour,
while in the Rowan the leaves grow alternately.
The name Mountain Ash is a mistake.</p>

1. Rowan Tree in Autumn<span class="gap">2. Flower Cluster</span><span class="gap">3. Leaves and Fruit</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rowan tree (1) is seen at its best among
the wild glens and mountains of the north and
west of Scotland. It requires air and light, and
will flourish in almost any kind of soil, and many
are the tales which are woven round the life of
this beautiful tree. It is called the Roan, or
whispering tree, because it has secrets to tell to
those who will listen. No witches or evil spirits
can cross a door over which a branch of Rowan
is nailed, and no harm will happen to him who
has a sprig of Rowan pinned to his coat. In
every churchyard in Wales a Rowan tree is
planted to scare away demons who might disturb
the sleep of the dead; and on lonely farms
high up on the mountain sides, the Witchin, or
Wiggin tree, as it used to be called, is placed
close beside the dwelling-house.</p>

<p>The Rowan is not a large tree; it grows easily
and requires no pruning, as its branches rarely
die, and the tree never loses its graceful shape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
The branches are wiry and slender, and they all
point upward. The bark is a dark purple colour
and is glossy and smooth; across it there are
many curious deep gashes, as if the tree had been
scored with a knife.</p>

<p>The Rowan is often planted in new coppices
to shield the young trees, but as soon as these
grow up and throw out many branches, they
stifle their kind nurse, which cannot grow without
plenty of light and air.</p>

<p>Early in spring the Rowan buds appear, fat
woolly buds covered with grey cottony down.
The young leaves (3) are carefully packed inside
among plenty of cotton wool, and very downy
they look when they first come out. Each leaflet
is toothed round the edge, and is dark glossy green
above and much paler green underneath. These
leaves remain on the tree till late in autumn,
then when the frost touches them with its icy
fingers they change to wonderful shades of gold
and scarlet and pink, and they fall with the
October winds.</p>

<p>The Rowan tree flowers (2) blossom in May, and
they grow in dense dusters, each flower at the
end of a small stalk. There are many small stalks,
all about the same height, and they branch again
and again from the main stem, forming a thick
cluster. The flowers are very delightful, though
they lack the snowy beauty and have none of the
delicate scent of the Hawthorn. Each Rowan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
flower has five green sepals and five creamy white
petals. These are placed round the end of the
flower stalk, which is slightly swollen, and inside
this swelling lies hidden the seed-vessel; you can
see three sticky threads rising from it in the
centre of the ring of petals. There is a circle of
yellow-headed stamens within the petal ring.</p>

<p>By the end of June the Rowan flowers have faded
and the creamy petals strew the ground. But the
tree does not only depend for its beauty on the
creamy flowers or on the changing leaves.</p>

<p>The swollen flower stalks have been growing
all summer, and now the end of each stalk has
become a small round berry (3), and a dense
cluster of these berries hangs in a bunch from the
main stem. In autumn these berries turn a rich
yellow red, and very brilliant they look among the
dark green leaves. Song birds love these Rowan
berries, and so long as any remain on the tree the
blackbird and thrush will be its constant visitors.</p>

<p>When corn was scarce in the hard winters of
long ago these Rowan berries were dried and
made into flour. Many people to-day make them
into jelly, which is a rich golden colour, but has
rather a bitter taste.</p>

<p>The wood of the Rowan tree is very tough, and
is principally used for making poles.</p>

<p>We cannot think of the Hawthorn as one of our
noble forest trees, like the Oak and the Beech;
it is dear to us as a village tree, a friendly, bushy
tree which has grown in our garden, or in the
fields and meadows close to our country cottages.
We remember the long sunny May days when we
gathered armfuls of its lovely blossoms, and the
frosty autumn mornings when its berries shone
like rubies on the bare, wind-stripped branches.
It has always been in close touch with our lives,
and it has left many pictures graven deep in our
memory.</p>

<p>The Hawthorn (1), or May, or White-thorn, as
it is often called from the colour of its flowers,
has been known to us since very long ago.
When the hero Ulysses came home from his
weary wanderings, he found his old father
alone; all the servants had gone to the woods
to get young Hawthorn trees to make a hedge,
and the old man was busy digging trenches in
which to plant them.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HAWTHORN<br />


1. Hawthorn Tree in Early Summer<span class="gap">2. Leaves and Blossoms</span><span class="gap">3. Fruit</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even in that far-off time people had discovered
that nothing makes so good a hedge as young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
thorn trees. They grow very quickly and send
out many side-shoots and small branches. Each
branch bears sharp thorns, and so closely do
these thorny branches grow together that it is
impossible to push your hand through the hedge
without being badly scratched. Young cattle
and horses love to feed on the Hawthorn leaves,
and one wonders how they can eat them without
getting many scratches.</p>

<p>Long after the time of Ulysses we find that
bunches of flowering Hawthorn were carried in
wedding processions as an emblem of hope, and
torches made of its wood were burned. There is
a strange old legend which tells how Joseph of
Arimathea landed on the island of Avalon at
Christmas-tide. He was very weary, and lay
down to rest, but first he planted his staff of
Hawthorn firmly in the ground beside him. And
in the morning he found that the staff had put
out roots and was covered with Hawthorn
blossoms. By this he knew it was meant that
he should stay in Avalon, and he built a monastery
for himself and his brethren and remained there
till he died.</p>

<p>Until not so long ago the country people in
England used to hold gay sports in the village
in the month of May. A tall mast, or Maypole,
was planted in the ground, and the men and
maidens decorated it with wreaths of Hawthorn
blossoms. Then they danced, and sang, and held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
merry games around the Maypole in honour of
summer&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>In early spring the Hawthorn tree, if you find
one growing singly in a field or meadow, is most
easily recognised by its bushy appearance. The
tree trunk is dark grey and very rough; often it
is twisted like a rope, but it is rarely a thick
trunk, as you seldom find a large Hawthorn.
Even when very old-about two hundred and fifty
years some are said to live&mdash;the Hawthorn is
always a small tree.</p>

<p>In April the young leaf buds appear; pale green
knobs, or little bundles, bursting from every
branch. Each leaf (2) is cut up into blunt fingers,
and soon it loses its paleness and becomes dark
green and glossy. In autumn these leaves change
to gold and dark red and brown; but the frosty
nights and cold winds soon strip them from the
branches.</p>

<p>May is the month when the flowers (2) begin to
bloom&mdash;clusters of tiny snow-white balls, each at
the end of a slender green stalk. In England it
was the custom to give a basin of cream for
breakfast to the person who first brought home
a branch of Hawthorn in blossom on the first of
May.</p>

<p>When the flower balls or buds unclose, you find
that they have five snow-white petals, which are
set in the throat of the calyx cup. Within this
ring of petals, round the mouth of the cup, grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
many slender stamens, each with a bright pink
head. And if you look at the back of the flower,
you will see five green points which stand out like
the rays of a star behind the white petals. These
are the sepals.</p>

<p>Below this green star the stalk looks slightly
swollen: this swelling contains the seed, and by
the time autumn comes it will have grown into
a small green berry. After the white petals and
the pink-headed stamens have fallen, you will find
clusters of these berries, which are called haws,
each with the withered remains of the sepals
clinging to the top, as you find them in the Rose
and in the Apple. The berries (3) become crimson
when the frost comes, and birds eat them greedily.</p>

<p>We have few trees which flower so beautifully
as the Hawthorn. In May and June the hedgerows
are laden with its masses of snowy blossoms.
Sometimes you will find Hawthorns on which the
flowers are a vivid crimson, and these are so
transparently beautiful they look as if the light
shone through them. And in autumn no tree is
more attractive than the Hawthorn, with its gleaming
berries and many-coloured leaves.</p>

<p>The wood of the Hawthorn is not very serviceable.
It is hard and may be highly polished, but
the trees are too small for the timber to be useful.</p>

<p>The branches, like those of the Ash and the Whin,
burn readily, even when green, and in Scotland
the bark was used in olden days to dye wool black.</p>

THE BOX</h2>
</div>

<p>Many of us only know Box as the name given
to the small bushy plant which is placed along
the edges of our garden borders to keep the
earth from falling out on the gravel path. And
we are surprised to learn that this plant is only
the Dwarf Box, and that the true Box is a tree,
a fair-sized tree, which may be seen any day in
Oxford growing to a height of over twenty feet.
We must learn to recognise the Box tree, for in
the South of England there are still many districts
where it grows freely.</p>

<p>It has been known in this country for hundreds
of years, but its fame has come down to us in a
curious way. In old books we read that the Box
was chiefly prized as the tree which would stand
more clipping than any other. People in those
days had a strange fancy for cutting trees and
bushes into quaint shapes. They had Box trees
which looked like peacocks, and Box trees shaped
like beehives. There were arm-chairs, and tubs,
and even statues made of growing Box, cut and
trimmed by the gardener&#8217;s clever shears.</p>

1. Box Tree<span class="gap">2. Leaf Spray with Flowers</span><span class="gap">3. Single Flower</span><span class="gap">4. Fruit</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best gardener then was the one who clipped
best, and a very difficult art it was, to clip the
tree into a certain shape and yet not to kill it.
Nowadays these quaint Box tree curiosities are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
scarcely ever made, but a Box tree hedge is
often planted, and its masses of closely-crowded
evergreen leaves afford good protection to young
plants in a windy garden.</p>

<p>The Box tree (1) has a dark grey-green bark,
and the young shoots are four-sided. It grows
very slowly&mdash;only a few inches each year&mdash;and because
of this the wood is very hard and fine, as
fine as ebony.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) are placed opposite each other,
and are small and egg-shaped, with smooth edges.
Above they are dark green and very glossy, but
underneath the colour is paler. They are very
poisonous these Box leaves, and fowls are known
to have died from eating them.</p>

<p>The poet Wordsworth tells us that at country
funerals it was usual to have a basin filled with
sprays of Box standing at the door, and every
friend who came to the funeral took a spray, which
he carried to the churchyard and laid on the new
grave. Rosemary or Yew sprays were often used
in the same way.</p>

<p>The flowers are very tiny; you will scarcely be
able to see how they are shaped without a magnifying-glass.
They grow in crowded yellow
clusters at the foot of the leaves, where they join
the stem. In each cluster there is usually one
seed flower (3) with a tiny green pea in the centre,
from which rise three curved horns. All the
other flowers will be stamen flowers, which shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
plenty of pollen dust over this single green pea.
The fruit (4) is a green berry, enclosing a tiny
black seed, which you cannot see.</p>

<p>Box-wood is very valuable and is scarce in
this country. Most of what we use comes from
other lands. In France there is a large Box-wood
forest near the village of St. Claude, and
all the people in that village spend their days
making the Box-wood into small articles, such as
forks and spoons, and rosaries and snuff-boxes,
for which they get a good deal of money. The
wood is pale yellow, and may be cut into the
finest pattern without breaking. For many years
Box-wood has been used by engravers for making
the blocks from which pictures and patterns are
printed; the wood is so hard that these blocks
can be used many, many times without the edges
becoming worn.</p>

<p>Near London there grew a famous wood called
Boxhill, and when the trees in that wood were
cut down they were sold for ten thousand pounds.</p>

THE WALNUT</h2>
</div>

<p>The Walnut tree (1) comes to us from sunny Italy
and France, where it has grown for many centuries
and is greatly prized. Its Latin name, <i>Juglans</i>,
means the nut of Jove, and the Romans called it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
so because they thought the fruit was worthy to
be set before their chief god Jove. It was brought
to this country about five hundred years ago, and
seems to have been grown in many districts until
the beginning of last century, when there came
a great demand for its wood. As much as six
hundred pounds was given for a single Walnut
tree, and at once all the people who had Walnut
trees cut them down and sold them. This greatly
reduced the number.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a large, handsome tree, which grows to a
considerable height, and has a very thick trunk
covered with grey bark. This trunk is smooth
when the tree is young, but turns rugged as it
grows older. The Walnut branches are large
and spreading; they are sometimes twisted, but
the tips of each branch always turn to the sky.
For long it was thought to be dangerous to sleep
beneath the shade of a Walnut tree, but for what
reason I have not been able to discover.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) are very handsome; each leaf is
made up of several pairs of leaflets placed opposite
each other on a central stalk, with a single leaflet
at the end. When they first come out these
leaflets are dull red, but the colour soon changes
to a pale olive green, and each leaf is smooth and
soft and has a delicious scent if crushed ever so
slightly. The twigs which carry these leaves are
very stout, even to the tips, but they break easily,
and you will find many lying on the ground after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
a windy night. The bark on these young twigs
is very smooth and glossy.</p>

<p>The Walnut tree produces two kinds of flowers,
which are both found on the same tree, and one
kind, the stamen flowers (5), requires a whole year
to ripen. If you look at the twigs which support
the leaves you will see several tiny cone-shaped
buds (3) dotted here and there on either side, close
to the scars (4) left by last year&#8217;s leaf stalk. These
are the beginnings of next year&#8217;s stamen flowers,
and they remain like that all summer and all
winter until the following spring. Then the bud
lengthens and becomes a slender, drooping catkin
(5). This catkin is covered with small flowers,
each made up of five green sepals enclosing
many stamens. These stamen catkins drop from
the tree when the pollen dust is scattered.</p>

<p>The Walnut seed flowers (6) are so small that
they require to be looked for carefully. They
grow among the leaves at the end of the twig, and
their small seed-vessels, each with a closely-fitting
calyx covering, are ready before the leaves
come out. Very soon the small seeds develop into
smooth green fruits, which continue to grow all
summer, and in July they are the size of a small
plum. This fruit is a nut (7), the famous Walnut,
and at first you will not see in it any likeness to
the Walnut which we eat at dessert after cracking
the pale brown shell. But look more closely.
The green fruit is a soft juicy envelope which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
conceals a large nut. This green envelope turns
brown when it is ripe and splits open, showing the
nut inside, a nut with a crinkled skin, which is soft
and green at first, but which becomes a hard, pale
brown shell when the fruit dries. It is the kernel
of this nut which we eat with salt as a dessert
fruit.</p>

<p>The Walnuts usually ripen in October, but often
they are gathered in July before the juicy green
covering has turned brown, and they are preserved
in vinegar and used as a pickle. Ripe Walnuts
contain a great deal of oil, and the oil is much
valued by artists, who mix it with their paints. It
is the most liquid of all the oils, and it dries very
quickly.</p>

<p>If you look at your fingers after gathering
Walnuts you will find that they are stained a dark
brown. The Walnut tree contains a juice which
leaves a dark stain. It is said that with this juice
the gipsies dye their skin brown; and it is also
used to stain floors.</p>

<p>Walnut wood is very valuable. It is light in
weight and dark in colour, with beautiful veins
and streaks throughout. Much fine furniture is
made of Walnut wood, and it can be polished till
it shines like satin. To-day it is largely used in
the manufacture of guns and rifles.</p>

<p>You will now understand what an important
tree the Walnut is, as it yields fruit and oil and
wood, which are all valuable.</p>

THE SWEET CHESTNUT OR SPANISH
CHESTNUT</h2>
</div>

<p>The Sweet Chestnut is a cousin of the Oak, and
belongs with it to the great family of cup-bearing
trees, or those that bear their fruit sitting in a
cup. Like the Oak, it is a tree with a great and
ancient history, although nowadays we are apt to
take little notice of this tree, which was once
well known and grew abundantly in many parts
of England.</p>

<p>The largest Chestnut in the world grows in
Sicily, in the great forest which covers the slopes
of Mount Etna. It is said that a Spanish Queen
was once overtaken in this forest by a tremendous
storm, and that she and a hundred soldiers and
horses were all able to find shelter beneath the
wide-spreading branches of this one tree.</p>

<p>In this country we have a famous big Chestnut
tree in Gloucestershire which is believed to be a
thousand years old; it is written about in old
books, which tell us that this tree belonged to a
certain house in the time of King Stephen.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Sweet Chestnut (1) is a large bushy tree
with beautiful leaves, which painters love to put
in the background of their pictures. The branches
are heavy and spreading, and they sweep downwards.
Each branch is thickly covered with long
green leaves (2), which are so thick and glossy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
that you expect them to be evergreen. Each leaf
is sharply oval, and has a stout rib running up
the centre, from which straight veins branch to
the very edge of the leaf, where they each end in a
point. These points make the edge of the leaf look
as if toothed. Insects do not destroy these Chestnut
leaves, and they hang on the twigs till late in
autumn, when they turn pale yellow; this yellow
deepens to gold and brown, and when winter
comes they cover the ground with a thick carpet
of rustling leaves. These leaves are often gathered
to make winter bedding for the poor people, who
call them &#8220;talking beds&#8221; because they rustle and
crackle so when lain on.</p>

<p>Those leaves that are left on the ground greatly
enrich the soil.</p>

<p>The trunk of the Chestnut tree is scored up and
down with many deep ridges, and these ridges
seem to bend round the tree strangely, as if they
had been twisted, like the strands of a rope, when
the tree was young and tender.</p>

<p>The Chestnut flowers appear on this year&#8217;s
shoots early in May or June, and they are of two
kinds, both of which grow on the same tree.
The stamen flowers (3) are in long catkin spikes,
which rise stiffly among the leaves. The centre
stem of the catkin is very stout, and seated round
it are tufts of yellow-headed stamens, each enclosed
in a green calyx. These stamen heads are filled
with yellow dust, which they shed in the same way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
as the Pine tree stamens, in such quantities that
it lies like sulphur on any still lake or pond that
may be near.</p>

<p>On the same catkin spike, near the foot, grow
the seed flowers (4). These look like short, fat
paint brushes with a stout green handle. There
is a cup made up of many slender green leaf-like
points, and inside this cup sit the seeds; you can
see a bunch of their points standing up like the
bristles of the paint brush. When plenty of the
stamen dust has fallen on these bristles, the seed
sets about getting ready its fruit, and the stamen
part of the catkin spike shrivels and falls off; its
work is done.</p>

<p>But the seed grows bigger and bigger, till it
looks like a round green ball (5) covered all over
with bristles. The seeds are ripening inside this
ball, two or three, sometimes five, seeds closely
packed side by side. In October the green covering
splits into four pieces and the seeds fall to the
ground. Notice how beautifully this bristly covering
is lined with soft, silky down to protect the
smooth skin of the nut.</p>

<p>Each nut is slightly flattened at the sides where
it was tightly pressed against its neighbour, and
it comes to a point at the top, where the withered
remains of the seed bristles show in a dry brown
tuft. The skin on the Chestnut is dark brown,
and there is a large scar at the foot of the nut
where it was fastened to the green cup.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>In Italy, where there are miles and miles of
Chestnut forests, the nuts are gathered in sackfuls
when October comes. They are then spread out
on a brick floor in a thick layer, and a fire, made
of dry leaves and sticks, is lit beneath. This fire
is kept burning for ten days, and the nuts are
frequently turned with a wooden shovel. Whenever
the skins crack off quite easily the nuts are
ready; the hard, cracked brown skins are removed,
and the nuts are ground into flour from which
many delicious foods are prepared.</p>

<p>The fruit of the Chestnut is one of the most
important tree fruits we know. In France and
Italy the people use Chestnuts as much as we
do potatoes, and many are the clever ways in
which they prepare and cook them, but the
commonest way is to boil and eat the chestnuts
with a little salt. When the cook is preparing
the nuts, he makes a slit in the skin of every
Chestnut except one, and when that one bursts
and cracks with a loud noise, he knows that the
others are ready.</p>

<p>The Chestnut fruit ripens in the South of
England, but it is never so large, nor is it so
plentiful, as in the sunny South.</p>

<p>The wood of the Chestnut tree is valuable. For
many years people believed that the great beams
in some of our old historic buildings were Chestnut
wood, and this made them think that the
trees must have grown much larger then than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
they do to-day. But it is now decided that these
old beams must be made of Oak. Old Oak beams
are very like Chestnut beams, but clever people
tell us that Chestnut wood is best when it is
young, as the old wood is apt to break off in
little pieces, and it would not really be a suitable
wood to use in buildings where strength was
needed.</p>

<p>Chestnut wood makes excellent fences and
is also used for wine casks; the hoops which
go round these wine casks should be made of
it, as it does not rot in a damp cellar. Chestnut
wood burns badly; it sends up a great many
sparks, and it smoulders, but will not burn
brightly.</p>

THE HORSE CHESTNUT</h2>
</div>

<p>The Horse Chestnut is not related in any way
to the Sweet Chestnut; there is no resemblance
between them except the appearance of their nuts,
and even in these there are many points of difference.
It is said that the name Horse Chestnut
was given because the nuts of this tree were
only fit for horses to eat, whereas the Sweet
Chestnuts are valuable as a food for human beings.
Even horses will not eat the nuts of the Horse
Chestnut tree. You must not forget that if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Chestnut is spoken of without an adjective, it is
the sweet Spanish Chestnut that has the right
to the name, and is by far the more valuable
tree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Horse Chestnut (1) was brought to this
country five hundred years ago, and we prize it
greatly for its beautiful flowers and leaves. It
has a large, stout trunk, covered with a rough,
scaly bark, on which you will frequently notice
many green patches caused by a tiny plant which
makes its home there.</p>

<p>The branches are large and spreading, and they
sweep downwards to the ground, then rise again
towards the tips, forming graceful curves. The
shoots bearing the buds always point towards the
sky, and in spring these shoots grow very fast
for about a month, then they do not become any
larger, but the shoot thickens and is soon tough
and woody.</p>

<p>All winter the Horse Chestnut buds can be
seen on the tree&mdash;large, dark, purply brown buds
(4) covered with a thick coating of sticky gum.
In April these buds begin to swell and the gummy
covering melts. It held together twelve dark
brown scales, and these fall to the ground, showing
an under layer of paler scales. The growing
bud inside soon pushes itself through these scales,
and the young leaf appears, a delicate, pale green
bud, with its leaves closely folded like a fan. They
open very quickly in the warm sunshine, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
some days after they have shaken themselves
loose from the scaly coverings each leaf (2)
hangs on its stalk like a half-opened parasol,
with all its tips pointing to the ground. But
soon the leaf tips rise, and the parasol is fully
opened and a beautiful leafy screen it is.</p>

<p>The leaf (3) is cut up into seven leaflets, and
every leaflet is shaped like a pear, with the broad
part pointing outwards and the narrow end joining
the leaf stalk. These pear-shaped leaflets are not
all the same size; there are two which are quite
small and two a little larger, and the other three
are larger still. The leaflets have small teeth
round their edges, and there is a raised rib running
up the centre, from which branches a network of
fine veins all over the leaflet.</p>

<p>The Horse Chestnut leaves grow opposite each
other in pairs, and each pair is placed cross-ways
to the pair farther down on the branch, in the
same way as those of the Sycamore. In July the
leaves begin to change colour; they turn red and
brown, and they fall very early in autumn. Look
closely at the twigs and you will see on them
many curious marks shaped like horse-shoes;
these are the scars (4) where a leaf stalk joined
the twig, and above each of these scars you can
see next year&#8217;s leaf bud already distinctly formed.</p>

<p>In May the Horse Chestnut is in flower (5), and a
wonderful sight it is; the tree is laden with snowy
spikes, which look like great candles set on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
bushy Christmas tree. A giant&#8217;s nosegay, it is
sometimes called by the country people, this great
tree, with its wealth of fan-shaped leaves and these
stiff snow-white spikes rising from every branch.</p>

<p>The lowest flowers (6) in each spike open first,
and they are called by botanists perfect flowers,
because each one has all its parts complete. They
have a green bell-shaped calyx with five divisions
round the mouth. Within this calyx are five
separate white petals, one of which is much larger
than the others, and these petals have many hairs
on them and are splashed with crimson and yellow
stains.</p>

<p>In the throat of this flower there are seven
stamens with curved stalks and pale salmon-coloured
heads, and among these you can see a
slender curved green thread rising from the seed-vessel,
which lies hidden in the centre of the
flower.</p>

<p>The upper flowers on the spike have no seed-vessel,
and they fall off as soon as their stamen
dust is scattered. The spike may bear thirty or
forty flowers, yet only a few will remain to produce
seeds after the beautiful petals are withered.</p>

<p>When this has happened the seed-vessel grows
larger and larger till it becomes a rough, horny
green ball (7) studded with short spines. It is not
bristly all over like the Sweet Chestnut fruit ball,
but is hard and smooth, and its spines are thick
and clumsy, with a wide space between each. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
you open one of these balls before the fruit is ripe,
you will find a nut inside, which is white and
polished like a piece of ivory and which fits the
covering closely. But if you leave the fruit to
ripen on the tree, then the green ball splits into
three pieces, and you see that the nut (7) inside
has shrunk a little and has become a rich, dark
brown. It is so glossy that it looks as if it had
just been oiled, and it is almost round.</p>

<p>There is a white scar at the foot of the nut,
where it was fastened to the inside of the green
ball.</p>

<p>In the Sweet Chestnut, you remember, there
were always two or three nuts inside each bristly
ball, and these nuts were dull, and not glossy like
those of the Horse Chestnut.</p>

<p>Although horses will not eat this fruit, deer and
cattle and sheep all like it. In this country the
nuts are usually left to rot on the ground where
they fall. After they decay these nuts may be
pounded and made into a kind of soap; they
contain a juice which is said to be good for
cleansing.</p>

<p>The Horse Chestnut is a very fast-growing tree.
In fourteen years a tree grown from a nut will be
large enough to sit under, and the wood, on this
account, is less hard and lasting than woods that
have taken longer to grow. It is used for cabinet-making
and for flooring.</p>

THE CEDAR OF LEBANON</h2>
</div>

<p>In the Old Testament we read that when Solomon
was building the temple he sent to Hiram,
King of Tyre, for stores of goodly Cedar wood from
the forests of Lebanon. And Hiram sent the
wood by sea in floats, or rafts, as much Cedar and
timber of Fir as King Solomon wanted. This
was used to cover the stonework of the temple,
within and without.</p>

<p>There is a delightful fragrance in these planks
of Cedar wood which is said to come from the sap
or resin with which the tree abounds. Cedar oil
is made from this resin, and it was long in use as
a safeguard against the attacks of insects, which
dislike the smell.</p>

<p>The Cedar (1), as we see it in this country, rarely
rises to the dignity of a large tree; it is most
familiar to us as a stunted, bushy tree with a
thick, short trunk divided into more than one
main stem. Short branches rise from these stems,
and at first these point upwards to the sky, but
after the branch has grown some length it bends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
backward and stands straight out from the tree.
From a distance the tree looks as if the branches
grew in layers, or shelves, with a clear space
between each shelf. You will always recognise
a Cedar by these layers of branches densely
covered with gloomy green leaves. It is said that
in countries where much snow falls the Cedar
branches always remain upright, because the tree
knows that it could not carry the great weight of
snow that would gather on its leafy shelves if
they grew flat as in warmer lands.</p>

<p>The Cedar is frequently found growing in
churchyards, beside the Yew tree, and a dark,
gloomy tree it is. The trunk is covered with a
thick rough bark of a pale greenish brown colour,
but on the branches this bark is thin and flaky.
The Cedar grows very slowly. The tree may be
a hundred years old before it produces any seeds,
though you sometimes find seedless cones on
Cedars that are twenty-five to thirty years old.</p>

<p>The leaves (2) are evergreen, and usually remain
on the twigs for four or five years. They grow in
tufts, like those of the Larch, on the upper side
of the twig; but each leaf is needle-shaped, as in
the Scotch Pine, and is much harder than the
soft Larch leaves. In colour they are a dark
bluey green.</p>

<p>The Cedar has two kinds of flowers. Those
that bear the stamens (3) appear at the end of
short, stunted little twigs which have taken many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
years to grow. The stamens are in slender
catkins, about two inches long, and are a pale
reddish yellow colour.</p>

<p>The seed flowers (4) grow in cones, and the
Cedar of Lebanon has very curious cones. They
grow in pairs, and are like fat green eggs, sitting
upright on the branch, with the blunt end uppermost.
These cones look quite solid, because the
scales are so tightly pressed together. You can
scarcely see where one begins and the other ends.
It takes two or three years before these scales
unclose, and during that time the cones (5)
become a rich, dark purple. When the scales
unclose, the three-cornered seeds are blown out
by the wind, and each seed is furnished with a
wing to float it away on the air. The Cedar cones
remain on the tree several years after all their
seeds have fallen.</p>

<p>The timber of the Cedars grown in this country
is of little value; the tree is usually planted for
ornament. But in warmer lands, where there are
large forests of mighty Cedar trees, the wood is
sold for a great deal of money.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
